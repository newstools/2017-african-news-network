Culture, arts and traditional affairs MEC Ontlametse Mochware called on artists to unite, speak with one voice and make sure they fought for their rights.She said this when she addressed the recent provincial arts lekgotla held in Rustenburg.Mochware said that the sorry sight of artists dying as paupers belonged in the past and placed greater responsibility on the sector to lead in this fight. We need artists to be organised and speak with one voice. It is, therefore, for the artists to hold their own structures accountable. To have a coherent voice that speaks truth to power, a voice of reason and sanity. Today we need organised formations that advocate for the course of artists through government policies and in particular the Arts, Culture and Heritage Policy. Although it is in its draft form, it does articulate the interests of the various art forms, she said.The MEC said that the government had a role to play to make sure artists were given a lifeline and leeway to grow.She said that the government had an obligation to ensure that the cultural and creative industries and arts, culture and heritage programmes and projects were included in national and provincial growth and development plans as well as the local government s integrated development plans. The past has seen much potential among artists wasted, we can t waste any more time by losing focus as cultural workers and artists. I expect you to be leaders in the industry and thereby provide meaningful guidance and contribution, which will take all of us into a future that we tailor-make through honest dialogue, Mochware said.Issues of arts and culture have been taken as one of the three key pillars upon which the economic development of the province is premised going into the future, she said.Mochware said that there were a number of industry-driven initiatives she looked forward to getting from the arts sector, including the establishment of a film commission at least in the next six months. I want a resolution that will promote indigenous language literature, a resolution in the area of craft and creative industry that will create more opportunities for all, she said.The MEC said that there was a need for artists and the department to have good relations so that they complemented each other going forward.At some point, artists in the province accused the department and the provincial government in general of overlooking them and using artists from other areas on the government functions.Mmabana Foundation CEO Dr Otsile Ntsoane also weighed in, saying there was a lot artists could do to revive the province as the hub of artistic development.Ntsoane said cooperation was key in contributing towards self-sustainable and self-reliant artists who could stand on their own and stop running to the government to ask for money.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
