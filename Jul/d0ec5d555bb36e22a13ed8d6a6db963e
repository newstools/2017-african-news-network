Public Service and Administration Minister, Faith Muthambi used her recent visit to Ratlou local municipality to remind North West residents of the Mandela Month ideals.Muthambi held an imbizo in Setlagole outside Mahikeng, where she met residents and listened to their service delivery concerns.She was accompanied by Ratlou mayor, Tebogo Modise, kgosikgolo Phoi of Barolong ba Ratlou and other leaders.The minister said it was imperative that locals take cognisance of the role the late Nelson Mandela played in his efforts to bring about better lives. As you are aware, the month of July is dedicated to celebrating the life and legacy of the founding father of our democracy Nelson Mandela. Both locally and internationally, on July 18, the world pauses to celebrate Nelson Mandela International Day in honour of the late statesman. Therefore in this month, South Africans and the nations of the world are called to contribute 67 minutes of their time, to help those in need in order to effect positive change in someone s lifein memory of the legacy of president Mandela, Muthambi said.She said the month of July called for all citizens to continue to live by the values of our Constitution that provides for the rights of all people and affirms democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom for all. This month also brings more to our commitment as the government and as reflected in the Constitution and the National Development Plan to continue to strive for human dignity and basic rights, where every citizen is able to access clean water, shelter, sanitation, feel safe, children have access to quality education and everyone is able to put food on the table for their families, through total eradication of the triple challenges of inequality, unemployment and poverty, Muthambi said.In response to the challenges still facing Ratlou communities, Muthambi said there was still more to be done before residents could fully realise the aspirations Madiba sacrificed so much for. On our arrival here, we had an opportunity to visit some of your service delivery points to gain firsth and experience and garner information about how we provide services as the government through our public institutions. We also had a chance to engage with frontline officials that you interface with when accessing these services. We have observed an improvement in how they are delivering services, challenges that continue to confront them, but most importantly, what we should do as the government and the community to make sure that they continue to deliver quality services, she said.Among the challenges Muthambi noted was lack of scholar transport for some pupils who live far from schools, bad infrastructure, lack of proper sanitation and acute water shortages.Resident Tebogo Maruping said sometimes people drink water from a stream due to the dire nature of water scarcity in the area.Residents also said there was lack of employment opportunities and young people end up indulging in drugs and other harmful activities.Ratlou was in the news for having some of the highest teenage pregnancies and school drop-out rates.The minister and her team promised that more attention will be paid on Ratlou and that they will be back to assess progress made in due course.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
