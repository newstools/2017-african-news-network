A petrol attendant in Belfast near Middelburg, who took time off his job to participate in the 2017 Comrades marathon, returned home with a silver medal.Samson Vilakazi, 29, also previously took part in the marathon and won a bronze medal.In an interview yesterday, Vilakazi said he developed his running skills at an early age while still at school where he used to participate in athletics competitions.He said his intention was to win the national race but his failure to achieve the target he set for himself would not discourage him from competing again. I believe that a long journey always starts with a short step. My intention was to come back home with a gold medal but I could not make it this time. I am proud to receive the silver medal because it encourages me that I will eventually make it to the top spot. During my spare time, I go on long runs because I love what I am doing. It would be wrong not to thank my employer for the sterling support provided to me during the marathon competition, Vilakazi said.He said he was prepared to encourage other youngsters willing to become athletes in this field. In order to succeed, you need to love what you are willing to achieve and remain committed despite all the hardships, especially if you do not have a sponsor, Vilakazi said.His sponsor and employer s representative, Dewald de Klerk, said they decided to provide sponsorship to Vilakazi due to his commitment to the sport. We are very proud of Samson s achievements. This was his fourth Comrades and he has previously won a bronze and two silver medals. He has also competed in several other major races, including Gods Window, which he has consecutively won for the past few years. We wish him every success for the 2018 Comrades where, with a bit of luck, we might even see Samson take gold, De Klerk said.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
