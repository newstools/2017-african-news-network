Abahlali baseMjondolo have experienced political violence as early as September 2009, the organisation s president Sbu Zikode said.Zikode was testifying at the Moerane commission on the political killings in Durban on Wednesday. Abahlali baseMjondolo experienced political violence. The violence against us (Abahlali) dates back to 26 and 27 September 2009, where a mob attacked my family, he said.Zikode told the commission that the people who attacked his family called themselves ANC members and the group also attacked a youth camp of Abahlali at a hall in Kennedy Road.The commission probe has established that the Glebelands hostel in Umlazi played a critical role in the killings, which found that at least 77 people were killed since March 2014.During the past week three ANC councillors were killed in Umzimkhulu ahead of the party s regional conference where new leaders were to be elected.This incident followed the shooting of the region&#8217;s speaker, Khaya Thobela, who was gunned down in April.Meanwhile, Zikode told the commission that his family was attacked because he was not found at Kennedy Road. He said guns, cane knives, stones and fire were used to destroy the offices of the organisation in 2009 on Kennedy road. Houses and spaza shops were set alight and destroyed while police watched. The attacks took place under the watch of the SAPS, metro police and public order officials in broad daylight, Zikode said.He further told the commission that what concerned them as Abahlali was the fact that all these incidents happened under the police watch, adding that the violence resulted in some of the people being displaced, others hospitalized, while two died in the attacks.-Sipho Jack
