The occupants of the truck were not injured.Two weeks ago, a truck collided with two minibuses, killing 18 people and injuring another 15 on the R541 between Machadodorp and Badplaas.Those killed were mine workers on their way to work when the accident happened. The truck driver was arrested.Community safety, security and liaison MEC Pat Ngomane s spokesperson, Joseph Mabuza, said the seriously injured passenger in Tuesday s accident was still in hospital.Mabuza said preliminary investigations revealed that the truck was travelling towards Mozambique when it collided with an oncoming car on the road, which was under construction. The driver of the truck said he lost control and collided with the oncoming car when he was trying to swerve to avoid another vehicle. For now, we still regard his statement as an allegation because the driver of the other vehicle is dead and nobody can give us his side of the story. A case of culpable homicide was opened for further investigation. The truck driver was not arrested pending a further probe, Mabuza said.He said the department was worried about the increasing number of road deaths involving trucks. We convey our condolences to the grieving families and wishing the survivors a swift recovery, Mabuza said. We are continuing to urge motorists to constantly adhere to traffic rules and remain patient, especially where the roads are under construction. FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
