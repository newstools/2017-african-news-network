The Free State Department of Health has on Friday denied reports that there is a crisis at Universitas Academic Hospital following the resignations of Professors at the institution.The departmental spokesperson Mondli Mvambi said the resignations should be taken in the right context and that it should not be used for political scores. We are calling for calm as the Department because these resignations should be understood in a proper context and we believe that they should not be politicised. Each of these cases has its unique context and confirms what we have always said about the scarcity of Doctors in the country, Mvambi said.He further said the department was not taken aback by the resignation of head of Urology, Prof. Schalk Wentzel as he was serving three months notice.Mvabi also clarified that the resignation of Prof. P.H. Wessels, saying he was due to retire and that he was been replaced by Professor Baloyi, who is currently head of the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.On whether the resignation of professors would not comprise service delivery, the spokesperson assured the people that will not be affected in anyway, adding that some of the position were filled and that they will also be looking internally and externally to close the gaps.Meanwhile, there were allegation of victimisation and not having enough staff, Mvambi dismissed the allegations saying no one reported such incidents. None of them have reported any cases of ill treatment and this surprises us to hear of victimization when there have not been any reports. Health is a collective good that should not be used as a political springboard, Mvambi reiterated.-Sipho Jack
