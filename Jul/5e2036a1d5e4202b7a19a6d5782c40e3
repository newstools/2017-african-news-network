Chairperson of the ANC NEC Subcommittee on Education and Health Naledi Pandor says the party has yet to thrash out a specific funding model in order to achieve free higher education.Pandor was speaking during a press conference in Johannesburg where she relayed the Legislature and Governance commissions report backs to plenary during the ANC&#8217;s recently held national conference.According to Pandor while no specific funding model had been developed during the conference they had agreed that they need to act with speed.&#8220;We need more research into defining the exact character to be used as a model for fee-free education,&#8221; said Pandor.According to Pandor education is a key pillar in the fight against the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment.&#8220;The ANC must continue to strengthen measures that will improve access to higher education with the ultimate goal of achieving free higher education for the poor and missing middle .Meanwhile Pandor added that it was decided that no poor student should be partially funded and that resources should be sought for full support.&#8220;For us free higher education for the poor includes subsiding cost of study which include tuition fees, accommodation and meals,&#8221; she said.Last year Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande recommended that institutions could hike their 2017 fees but not more than 8%.He also said that students who qualify for NSFAS and the missing middle students would not be paying a fee increase for 2017.Missing middle students are those who are deemed too rich for NSFAS assistance but too poor to afford tuition fees.Following the outbreak of #FeesMustFall protests President Jacob Zuma established a commission of Inquiry looking into the feasibility of fee-free Higher education and training.The commission has been extended to next year and is expected to submit a full report to President Jacob Zuma in June next year.-TNA Reporter
