Three suspected rhino poachers will appear the Hluhluwe Magistrate s Court as the battle to save the endangered animals continues throughout the country.In the province, the number of rhino poached has risen to 119 and 80 arrests have been made so far in the battle to save the endangered giants. With the latest arrest of the three suspects aged 44, 24 and 28, it brings the total to 83.Police spokesperson Lt-Col Katlego Mogale the three suspects were arrested on Saturday night when their vehicle was stopped and searched in Mgwanwini, Hluhluwe. The team was acting on information received when they spotted a white Toyota double cab in the Mgwanwini area. The police stopped and searched it and found a high calibre hunting rifle, a silencer, ammunition and an axe, Mogale said.The suspects will be facing charges of unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Mogale said the police had prioritised the killing and poaching of rhinos.The latest arrests follow two others in the Nkangala area, 2km outside of Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park.Ezemvelo said it was also the result of a tip-off from concerned citizens last week when two suspicious men were seen hiking outside the reserve.Members of the Ezemvelo Anti Poaching Unit (APU) who approached them, said they found the suspects clothing covered in blood.Following some questioning by the APU, the two suspects allegedly confessed to poaching a rhino and voluntarily led the APU to where they had hidden the horn. These arrests prove our Anti Poaching Unit has not lost hope in its war against poaching. It would have been easier for them to be despondent by now but they continue putting their lives in danger. The intelligence information that the communities living adjacent to our game reserves continue to share with us has contributed immensely in our fight against this onslaught, Ezemvelo CEO Dr David Mabunda said.Also last week Ezemvelo APU arrested one suspect at Makhamisa Section after gunshots were heard early on Monday morning.When the APU went to investigate, they came under fire and wounded one suspect who was later arrested while the other two managed to escape.-SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
