The department of social development has come up with a significant change programme to improve the way that the department works with non-profit organisations.The department said many changes were taking place within the sector informed by the initiatives by national DSD and national Treasury.Social development HoD Mokone Nthongoa said there were many challenges that needed to be addressed.The department said it was embracing the journey towards the department s shared vision improved outcomes for the people of the Free State, and in particular the most vulnerable where it was seeking to address various issues, including making it easier to work together, through clear and consistent processes and documents.The issues also included committing to and ensuring on-time payments of funding, reducing red tape so that NPOs could spend more time providing services and less time on the government administration.There was also a need to improve transparency with respect to the NPO funding process to help NPOs plan for the future, ensuring that the requirements for working together are made simpler and clearly explained and recognising the wealth of knowledge that NPOs have about the needs of Free State communities and making sure we use that knowledge to inform policies and initiatives.Nthongoa said addressing challenges and creating an environment for efficient, effective and sustainable relationships could not be achieved overnight. The department is looking at the end-to- end processes that relate to how we work together.The department has contracted KPMG to assist with some of the key elements of this roadmap, including the funding models, processes and communication plan, she said.The department said it was prioritising the things that affected NPOs the most thus ensuring prompt awards, contracting and payments in order that NPOs could provide important social welfare services to our communities.It said things would continue to change each year as the department continued to build, for example moving toward a differentiated risk-based approach, whereby funding and monitoring requirements will be tailored to the NPO depending on its experience and size.The department recognised the NPO sector in the Free State is diverse and a one size fits all model would not achieve the best outcomes for all involved. We are trying to find a balance between doing all changes at once, which can cause more disruption, versus a phased approach appropriate which prioritises the biggest issues. Our efforts in the Free State are part of a broader initiative by the national Treasury and national DSD to review NPO legislation, policies and processes, and strengthen the information base. The Free State is excited to be the pioneer for implementing improvements to how the government works with NPOs, the department said.So far, strides have been made in reviewing the challenges and understanding the opportunities for change.Progress to date includes establishing a dedicated project team to focus on improvements to NPO processes, analysing full cost of services by NPOs based on recent beneficiary data and funding allocation scenarios that help ensure the best outcomes for NPOs.LERATO KAPAprovinces@thenewage.co.za
