Traffic came to a standstill on the notorious Moloto Road in KwaMhlanga at the weekend when the police and religious leaders held a service to pray against crime.The abuse of women and children were among the issues raised during the march.The KwaMhlanga cluster accommodates several police stations including Verena, Kwaggafontein, KwaMhlanga, Kwaggafontein, Mmametlhake and Tweefontein.A similar campaign was also held by the police in the Pienaar cluster in Mbombela on Saturday.Provincial police commissioner LtGen Mondli Zuma s spokesperson Brig Leonard Hlathi said such campaigns would also be rolled out to various police clusters like Secunda early next month in a bid to show solidarity with the community.Hlathi said the police were also concerned about serious crimes such as cash in-transit heists and were working hard to discourage such deeds. As the police, we have decided to partner with religious leaders in the fight against crime as we believe that some of the criminal activities deserve an intervention from God as well. However, we are warning such criminals that we will leave no stone unturned, Hlathi said.He said a number of unlawful firearms were also seized by the police. Last week, five armed men were arrested while they were allegedly on their way to commit a robbery at a shopping centre in Siyabuswa. The confiscated firearms would have been used to kill many people in a short period of time, Hlathi said. We also appeal to the communities to get rid of such merciless people in the society by cooperating with the police since lawbreakers deserve to rot in jail, .FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
