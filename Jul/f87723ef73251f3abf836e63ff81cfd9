With the increasing levels of unemployment in the Eastern Cape, the youth brigade programme provides training opportunities and much needed skills to the youth.These youth volunteers will build houses for the destitute in the poverty stricken villages of Ntabankulu in the Alfred Nzo district municipality.Human settlements spokesperson Lwandile Sicwetsha says the completed houses will be given to beneficiaries by MEC Helen Sauls-August with both local and district mayors as a launch of the part of the Mandela Day activities. Unemployed youth were identifies to work as volunteers in a youth build training programme for a period of six weeks. The department collaborated with the National Home Builders Registration Council to train young people on technical skills and the Ntabankulu local municipality to identify the young people within the various wards of the local municipality, Sicwetsha said.He says the department is prioritising human settlements development in rural areas with half of the total number of developments.The percentage of households living in traditional dwellings has also declined from 18.3% in 1996 to 7% in 2016. Meanwhile, member of the leadership for #HireAGraduate Wandisile Sisoxho is not excited about this programme. This is just a waste of time and it is postponing the actual problem by keeping people busy. After equipping these people with skills, what then? Coega, IDZ and IDAM does this already but still there is a pool of unemployed graduates both from university and colleges. The majority of them have settled to be cashiers, Sisoxho said.He said colleges already provide 75% of practicals and still their graduates remain unemployed.However, according to the labour force survey issued by Statistics SA this month, the province saw an increase in unemployment from 28.4% in the fourth quarter of last year to 32.2% in the first quarter of the year.The statistics report of 2016 shows there are 1 773 255 households in the province.Of these, 471 698 households are situated in rural areas.Sicwetsha says the youth brigade programme is a departmental response to the call of upscaling government interventions for youth development. Youth will participate in this programme either as professionals, labourers, entrepreneurs or beneficiaries.The youth will gain artisan development, employment and enterprise development and professional development.More than 200 young people have been trained since the programme started and have gone on to receive further technical training through training and vocational institutions.The Eastern Cape distribution of households whose main dwelling is a government subsidised dwelling increased to 386 802 in 2016. Those living in informal dwellings have decreased slightly from 16.2% in 1996 to 13% in 2016.This programme is intended to help unemployed youth and assist in addressing the housing backlog in the province.SISANDA MADWANTSIprovinces@thenewage.co.za
