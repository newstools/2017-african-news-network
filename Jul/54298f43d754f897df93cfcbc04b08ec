Police yesterday advised those who wish to help in the identification processes of five people killed in a horrific collision between a double cab bakkie and a truck on the Polokwane-Mogwadi road to come forward. All those killed were on board the red Mitsubishi double cab and were burnt beyond recognition, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said. Our forensic investigators are up and running but race, gender and ages of the victims will only be known once DNA tests are complete. We are also circulating registration details of the vehicle to determine its owners, and those who wish to help or suspect the victims to be their relatives should visit Westernburg police station outside Polokwane and look for Capt Dikgale. The police said the bakkie was travelling on the R521 towards Polokwane when it collided with a truck. The Mitsubishi burst into flames, killing all the occupants inside while the truck driver escaped with minor injuries, Ngoepe said. The cause of this accident is not clear yet and a case of culpable homicide has been opened. Department of transport and community safety spokesperson Joshua Kwapa said several other people were killed in various parts of the province bringing the death toll on the roads at the weekend to at least 12. Four people were killed on the N1 outside Polokwane in a collision between two sedans while two men were knocked down by a vehicle at Ga-Magongwa village in Mokopane on N11. A driver was killed at Sekiding in Blouberg when a sedan ploughed into the back of another sedan. We are very worried about these loss of lives and will obviously intensify our road patrols and monitoring, especially during weekends, Kwapa said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
