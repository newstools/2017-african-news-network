AN ALLEGED property hijacker was arrested in Johannesburg while another managed to escape during a crime prevention operation in several hijacked properties along Davies Street in Doornfontein.The arrest comes as the city of Johannesburg cracks down on hijacked buildings like Vannin Court, Florence and Cape York, which was recently set alight, leaving thousands homeless.The anti-crime operation in the Joburg CBD on Saturday evening resulted in the arrest of 102 suspects of whom 98 were undocumented persons. They were detained at the Jeppestown police station.During the operation, two people were also arrested for possession of drugs. Several dangerous weapons including seven knives were confiscated.One shop owner was served with a R20000 fine by the SAPS for employing undocumented persons. Several shops along Rocky Street were inspected and it was discovered that some of the shops were selling expired goods.One person was also arrested for the possession of a fraudulent city of Johannesburg certificate of acceptability, purported to have been issued by the city s environmental health department.The director of strategic stakeholder management of group forensic and investigation services in Johannesburg, Lucky Sindane, said the city had to follow certain processes when dealing with people living in hijacked buildings. Those that are documented, we find alternative accommodation for them as they are registered with home affairs.However, those who are here illegally are detained by the police and within 48 hours a court date is set for them.After the judgment is made they are than sent to Lindela Repatriation Centre. The immigration officials employed by the department of home affairs are responsible for the apprehension, detention, processing and eventual release or repatriation of detainees, Sindane said.He said they would have to work together with the department of social development and home affairs in order to ascertain the exact number of foreign nationals that are either undocumented or documented living in hijacked buildings.Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba has again warned against inner city degeneration. It is vital that the rule of law is respected. I see the revitalisation of the inner city as key to ensuring economic growth and job creation in Joburg, Mashaba said.Meanwhile, the Tshwane central cluster SAPS arrested 78 suspects during weekend crime prevention operations in Pretoria.Seven people were arrested for possession of suspected stolen property, nine for theft, two for possession of car hijacking equipment, six for fraud and two for house breaking and theft.Those arrested will appear in the Hatfield Community Court and Pretoria Magistrate s Court today.The crime prevention operations were conducted in Brooklyn, Garsfontein, Lyttelton, Sunnyside, Silverton, Pretoria Moot and Villieria at the weekend.
