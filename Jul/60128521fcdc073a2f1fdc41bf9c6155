The provincial health department has suspended a medical doctor from Elim Hospital near Louis Trichardt who was arrested last week for allegedly dealing in nyaope and other illicit drugs.Department spokesperson Thabiso Teffo said: While we subscribe to the notion of innocent until proven guilty, we have served the doctor with immediate suspension to pave the way for internal investigations. The department will follow the case closely while providing the necessary assistance to the law enforcement agencies in ensuring that justice was dispensed expeditiously.Police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said: Mpho Paul Lekalakala, 35, who is a medical doctor at Elim Hospital was granted bail of R1000 and his co-accused Vukosi Maluleke, 30, was slapped with an admission of guilt fine of R300 by the Waterval Magistrate s Court.Lekalakala s case was postponed to August 1 for further investigation. Police said the duo were arrested in the Waterval area outside Louis Trichardt. The doctor and his accomplice were apprehended in a house after following up information. During the arrest, police confiscated nine sachets of nyaope, four hard rocks, two smoking pipes and one plastic bag containing dagga, Ngoepe said.The provincial health department said medical doctors should always live according to their oath of office. Doctors have taken an oath to look after the well-being of our people and as such they are consequently expected to uphold the highest moral fibre in the society. This kind of act by a medical doctor serves to undermine and bring the name of the profession into disrepute. We remain resolute in our condemnation of any illegal acts that undermine the government efforts to fight against drug abuse, the department said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
