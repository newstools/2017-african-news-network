Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) employees from Kimberly participated in a charity drive last Thursday as part of remembering the late president Nelson Mandela.They contributed money out of their pockets, purchased non-perishable food items and clothes and donated them to the Living Waters community wellness and development agency in Galeshewe. We also wanted to take part in the global call of giving back to the less privileged in our communities, Transnet s Kelebogile Mogoiwa said.On July 18, South Africa celebrated former president Nelson Mandela s birthday but the government urged citizens to embrace the chance to celebrate Mandela s life for the whole of July.This gives everyone the opportunity of recognising their individual power to make an impact and change the world around them.The Nelson Mandela Foundation said Mandela s life had been an inspiration to the world.By devoting 67 minutes of their time, one minute for every year of Mandela s public service, people can make a small gesture of solidarity with humanity and a step towards a global movement for good.Yolanda Essie-Reed, project manager and founding member of the Living Waters agency, was elated that companies such as TFR noticed what the communities were going through. We sometimes struggle to feed them. It s a blessing and we were not expecting this. It really shows that there are people who care, Essie-Reed said.Nico Loff, the agency s chairperson, said: Thank you to Transnet. It shows that there are good people out there. No matter how small the contribution is, we appreciate any help that we can get. The elderly and the children were extremely thankful. The agency prepares food daily for poverty-stricken community members.It was founded in 2012 to cater for people afflicted by poverty.It serves an average of 125 elders and 175 children who are dependent on the agency for a plate of food.It also aids them with sanitary products and food parcels.Living Waters is run at the back of a spaza shop and any profits made from the shop go directly to the agency.ANGEL MAHLOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
