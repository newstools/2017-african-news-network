The provincial government has vowed to improve the living conditions of the elderly, child-headed households and impoverished people in Govan Mbeki local municipality by providing them with decent houses.Human settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo made the promise while speaking at an imbizo in Embalenhle township near Secunda on Friday.Mashilo said his visit to the area was intended to strengthen democracy and public participation with communities.He said it also provided an opportunity for community members to interact directly with government officials on service delivery issues and find out more about departmental achievements and plans. This forms the basis for sustained dialogue between the government and people and is a mechanism for fact finding by the government to align services with the needs of the people, Mashilo said. This assists us in realising an efficient development-orientated public service and empowered, fair and inclusive citizenship through a well-functioning communication system that also proactively informs and engages the public about what the government is doing to improve their lives. He said the delivery of houses and availability of land would eliminate the challenge of land invasion, which hindered the provincial government s mission to provide sustainable development. Despite the challenges of bulk infrastructure and the lack of building sites in the area, our focus is on helping the elderly, disabled and child-headed families to get decent houses. We are happy because we started the day by handing over 500 houses and more than 600 title deeds to deserving beneficiaries from various parts of the municipality, Mashilo said.He said his department was committed to constructing a variety of accommodation this financial year. The department has planned to deliver about 3000 housing units, 287 gap market housing units, 500 rental housing units and social amenities in the 2017-18 financial year, Mashilo said.francen@thenewage.co.za
