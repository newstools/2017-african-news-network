One of the restorative, rehabilitative and punitive sanctions imposed on the three Stellenbosch University students found guilty of placing Nazi-like posters found on campus, include 100 hours of community service.The disciplinary hearing continued until last week when the university s disciplinary committee concluded that the three students were guilty.The students were found guilty of contravening clauses 9.3 and 9.6 of the institution s student disciplinary code.The university stipulated in a statement that the community service sanction imposed on the students had to be completed before the end of the first semester of 2018.A total 60 hours must be completed by the end of the 2017 academic year. In addition, the students must complete a restorative assignment on the topic of constructive engagement on campus.The students must submit the first draft to the panel not later than the last day of the third term of 2017.The second draft is to be submitted to the panel not later than the last day of the academic programme in the second semester of 2017. The due date for the final assignment is the first Monday of February 2018.The remainder of 40 of the 100 hours of community service must be used to implement ideas of constructive engagement as determined in the restorative assignment.The three students have been warned that if any one of them failed to comply with any of the elements of the sanction, they would be expelled immediately.The disciplinary hearing and subsequent punitive measures stems from a poster incident with Nazi undertones which had been put on campus in May.The posters, titled The Anglo-Afrikaner student called for students to fight for Stellenbosch and the image on the poster was reminiscent of Nazi-era propaganda.Following a huge outcry by staff and students, the matter was investigated by the university s equality unit.-VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
