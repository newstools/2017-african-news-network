A woman who was arrested for stealing a newborn baby boy from a labour ward at Tonga Hospital in Tonga outside Malelane on Saturday morning is expected to appear in the Tonga Magistrate s Court today.The incident occurred after the woman, 19, pretended to be pregnant, entered the labour ward for delivery and stole the baby about 2am while his mother was away.She was later cornered by the hospital s security guards, apparently after she put the baby inside a bag and tried to leave the hospital premises.She failed to produce the necessary documentation to confirm she was the baby s mother.Tonga police spokesperson Capt Mzwandile Nyambi said the suspect faced a charge of stealing a child. Our preliminary investigation showed that the suspect faked a pregnancy when she went into the maternity ward where she grabbed a baby and put it inside a bag. The hospital guards noticed her action and immediately summoned the police. She was then arrested on the scene and will appear in court, Nyambi said. The incident has also shaken health MEC Gillion Mashego.Mashego s spokesperson Dumisani Malamule said Mashego said the theft of babies at hospitals would not be tolerated and such people deserved to be punished accordingly.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
