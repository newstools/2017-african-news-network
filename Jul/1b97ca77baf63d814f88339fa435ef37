A high-level team of police investigators has been appointed to find the killers of KwaMaphumulo Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson, Mzobanzi Mthethwa, who was laid to rest on Sunday.Mthethwa was ambushed and killed two weeks ago in KwaMaphumulo, in what was seen as a well-orchestrated attack.The motive for his attack is believed to have been the role he played in the CPF.Transport, community safety and liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda said Mthethwa had been at the forefront of fighting crime and was widely respected for his courage in mobilising the community in the fight against crime.Kaunda said the team appointed to investigate the murder was already working on the case and Kaunda had said they would make a breakthrough very soon. We regard the brutal murder of Mthethwa as an act by criminals to instill fear in the community by criminals. Our message is clear: communities must never surrender to criminals. We will never allow community crime fighting structures to be targeted by criminals. Such brutality must instead strengthen our resolve as communities to work together with the police and isolate criminals from our communities, Kaunda said.On Sunday, hundreds of mourners came to the Mthethwa household to bid a final farewell to the slain chairperson and community member.A warning was also issued to criminals that their time was up.Kaunda said anyone attacking community crime-fighting structures was waging a war against the community and urged the communities to unite and defend themselves against dangerous criminals. The role and work of community crime-fighting structures in this province is amazing and we commend their bravery. Police are closing in on the suspects. They confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated, however, no arrests had been made.KwaMaphumulo has been in the news for the wrong reasons lately, including taxi violence, faction fights, use of illegal firearms and other forms of criminality.Kaunda, while visiting the grieving family assured them and all stakeholders that he would not rest until there was stability in the area.In a separate incident last week, police arrested a 65-year-old suspect following a raid at a homestead after a tip-off about illegal firearms.Police recovered four high calibre firearms in one homestead during a police raid.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
