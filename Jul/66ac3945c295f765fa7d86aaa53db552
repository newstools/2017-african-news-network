Our people in this municipality need to come together in their diversity to fight racism whenever it raises its ugly head., he said.Areas of Tlokwe and Ventersdorp have in the recent past been plagued by racial incidents, more than any other area in the province, and Mahumapelo said that it must come to an end.He used the opportunity to condemn racial incidents reported in Swartruggens, Coligny, Koster, Rustenburg, Delareyville and Ottosdal.The premier pointed out that the province had introduced what he called the small dorpies reconciliation, healing and renewal programme , to assist farm workers and their families who were often victims of racism.
