The United States on Monday branded Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a &#8220;dictator&#8221; threatening his country&#8217;s democracy and imposed sanctions targeting any assets he might hold on US territory.&#8220;Yesterday&#8217;s illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people,&#8221; US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement announcing the action.Sunday&#8217;s vote in Venezuela to elect a Constituent Assembly that would supersede the country&#8217;s opposition-controlled National Assembly has earned international scorn, with the US leading a group of nations refusing to recognize the election.-AFP
