The government was impressed that more than 800000 children in the country were enrolled in early childhood development (ECD) centres and would like the number to increase.This was said by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa who joined Premier Stan Mathabatha, community leaders and residents in painting the Ramadimetja Sophy Mogotlane ECD Centre in Mookgophong on Tuesday.Ramaphosa officially handed over the facility to the community.The centre was established through a public-private partnership programme which saw pharmaceutical company Cipla contributing R6.2m towards construction and equipment.The high tech modular centre accommodates 124 children up to the age of five.The facility is climate controlled and enables each class to operate in isolation to accommodate children with TB.The opening ceremony was coupled with voluntary community service to mark International Nelson Mandela Day. Ramaphosa also paid tribute to Madiba. We will always remember him for his great respect. We thank him for having given his entire life so that we can be free. Nelson Mandela was a man who led with great dignity without thinking of himself. He always thought about the nation, not himself, Ramaphosa said.In another ceremony to mark the legacy of Mandela, Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi helped paint classrooms at Kgalushi Secondary School in Maleboho in the Senwabarwana area on Tuesday.Maswanganyi joined community leaders and parents in motivating pupils that despite lack of facilities such as laboratories, they should keep on producing good results.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
