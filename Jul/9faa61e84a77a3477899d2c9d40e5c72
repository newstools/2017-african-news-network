The post audit action plan (PAAP) is one of the interventions put forward to address the perennial challenge of poor audit outcomes at North West municipalities.Together with numerous other interventions, PAAP is expected to put municipalities in line to attain clean audits that have evaded numerous municipalities.The plan was presented during a joint committee sitting of the provincial select committee on public accounts (Scopa) and the portfolio committees on local government and human settlements and that of premier, finance, economy and enterprise development.The departments of local government and human settlements and finance, economy and enterprise development presented plans they hope would turn around the municipalities fortunes.The two departments promised to assist municipalities with additional technical and financial support.Also present at the meeting were the office of the auditor-general and the South African Local Government Association (Salga).In his 2015-16 report auditor-general (AG) Kimi Makwetu labelled the North West as the worst performing province in the country.According to the acting business executive at the provincial AG s office, Schalla van Schalkwyk, one of the key reasons for the regression on the municipal audit outcomes was due to the poor quality of annual financial statements and the outcomes remained unchanged over the past five years due to basic controls not being implemented throughout the year to ensure accurate and reliable financial reporting. There is also a lack of sustainability on qualification areas in each municipality for over three years. All municipalities continued to rely on consultants for financial reporting, including preparing financial statements at a cost of R130.3m in the 2015-16 financial year yet all the financial statements submitted for auditing had material misstatements. Out of the 23 municipalities, 19 were assisted by consultants but still did not achieve unqualified audit outcomes. It is also very important to note that in the financial year under review, four municipalities obtained unqualified results only because material adjustments were made. If misstatements were not corrected, no municipalities would have had an unqualified opinion, Van Schalkwyk said.He said that a further R3.3bn of irregular expenditure was incurred during 2015-16, which mostly related to supply chain management transgressions and it brought the total balance (excluding Rustenburg local municipality which did not submit annual financial statements on time during the audit period) of unresolved irregular expenditure as disclosed in the financial statements at June 30, 2016 to R7.4bn.Unauthorised expenditure of R2.4bn was incurred in 2015-16, mainly as a result of overspending on approved budgets because of a general lack of understanding of the budget process and inadequate monitoring of spending.Finance MEC Wendy Nelson said that the provincial treasury was guiding municipalities to improve their internal control environment on addressing the audit findings and to better prepare for financial year end processes and improve the audit outcomes. All municipalities have adopted PAAP and consultants were appointed to assist beneficial municipalities with clearing of prior year audit findings.Of the four municipalities supported, three municipalities had improved audit outcomes and one municipality maintained its audit outcome although there was a significant decrease in the number of audit findings, she said.Nelson said that the technical advisors programme was aimed at assisting in contributing towards the financial viability and sustainability of municipalities, improved overall compliance of Municipal Finance Management Act and financial management performance and monitoring of implementation of PAAP. We are also providing technical hands-on support and building capacity within the municipal budget and treasury offices, she said.Her counterpart at the local government department, Fenny Gaolaolwe, said some of the key departmental support included monitoring of municipal infrastructure grants implementation, provincial infrastructure grant support to prioritise water and sanitation backlogs and establishment of the audit room to assist municipalities improve their audit outcomes. The audit room assesses municipalities capacity to submit records during audit and assist municipalities on preparing records for audit to substantiate entries in the annual financial statements. We have also capacitated municipal public accounts committees to perform their oversight responsibilities, Gaolaolwe said.Local government and human settlements portfolio committee chairperson Motlalepula Rosho said that programmes presented were aimed at assisting and supporting municipalities with the local government financial experts, asset management, municipal financial management, the government debts, municipal standard charts of account, revenue enhancement and post audit action plans would improve the financial statuses of many municipalities in the province. The joint committees are satisfied that the departments have also prioritised records management which has been a key audit finding in the past financial years. The local government department s enforcement of implementation of ward level improvement plans by municipalities will ensure that there is direct service delivery and monitoring incorporation of community concerns on the integrated development plan (IDP) and council agendas, she said.Finance committee chairperson Raymond Elisha said it was critical for the joint committees to understand the reasons behind supply chain management transgressions and lack of consequence management when there was sufficient capacity in municipalities. Municipal councils should include a clause in the senior managers contracts where lack of consequence management is a dismissable offence. It should also be embedded in the contracts of consultants to include skills transfer. Ward committee reports must be processed and implemented in their respective municipal councils, he said.Scopa chairperson Mahlakeng Mahlakeng expressed misgivings on Salga s lack of commitment to and support for municipalities. In the near future, we are going to call Salga to account on their support to the municipalities as lots of money is paid into the association but we cannot assess their impact. Salga must present a turnaround plan with clear time frames on how it is improving municipal audit outcomes, he said.Mahlakeng said that the joint committees would propose a legislature resolution on dealing with irregular, unauthorised and fruitless and wasteful expenditure. We will also establish a team to monitor implementation of such a house resolution and ensure that supply chain management transgressors are held liable, he said.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
