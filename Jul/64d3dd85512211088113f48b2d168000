The police in the province have advised farmers to obtain proper identification of employees in order to make necessary follow-ups when the need arises.The plea follows after robbers, suspected to be former employees, broke into a house at Speculatie Farm in Tom Burke near Lephalale and stole cash, including dollars, guns and other items last weekend. The suspects used what appeared to be a grinder to cut the safe open and made away with an undisclosed amount of US dollars and hunting rifles. The gang also stole four plasma TV sets and loaded them onto the farmer s Isuzu bakkie which they drove away in. Some of the hunting rifles that were in the safe were found on a bed in one of the rooms of the house, police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said.A subsequent massive hunt comprising a K9 unit, tracking team and detectives led to the recovery of the bakkie with a flat tyre about 10km from the crime scene. Four plasma television sets were still in the back of the bakkie but the dollars and hunting rifles were missing. We are investigating the possibility that the suspects might have been previously employed at the farm, Mojapelo said.Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba congratulated officers for their quick response in recovering some of the stolen items.-MONTSHO MATLALA
