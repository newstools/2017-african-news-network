The provincial department of water and sanitation is set to bring all role players in the sector under one roof with the intention of formulating lasting solutions.Provincial spokesperson Amogelang Moholoeng said the aim of the meeting is to develop a water and sanitation master plan to address water-related challenges.He said the workshop also seeks to bring everyone on board so the problems faced should be addressed as a collective.Moholoeng said although the plan would be developed by the department, it was going to be owned by water sector stakeholders including the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs, the business sector and civil society. The water and sanitation sector in South Africa faces continuously evolving challenges as the demands and patterns of water use change with the changing social, environment, economic and technological factors, he said.He said it was important that all relevant stakeholders were part and parcel of drawing up a way forward. Water and sanitation services require a coordinated and integrated approach to ensure all people in South Africa have access to potable water and dignified services, he said.Meanwhile, the department will clean the Bosman Canals in Douglas on Mandela Day.This is part of the initiative they embarked upon for a clear rivers campaign throughout the month.Moholoeng said the department has identified water canals in Douglas where illegal dumping was threatening to pollute the Orange River system.He said through the community-based partnership, the department had established a forum which would be used to clean up solid waste from the canals to ensure the water resources remained positive.Moholoeng said the department initiated the clean-up campaign with the aim of clearing the rivers of any unwanted aspects. The campaign seeks to create environmentally conscious communities by engaging them in promoting awareness and protecting our water resources. Volunteerism is actively encouraged as part of a proactive approach to protect our rivers, streams, wetlands and other ecosystems, he said.Moholoeng said it was of importance to ensure the water in the rivers was clean with a key focus of creating jobs and sustaining the environment as well as driving the economy of the province and ultimately of the country.He said the department was discouraging littering in rivers in any form and these people needed to be reported to the authorities.The department of water and sanitation has called members of the community to continue saving water this winter period.The message comes after the department said there had been a decrease in water levels in the province, which stands at 91.5% from the 100% reported recently. Water levels are continuing to drop gradually, despite good rains that have been experienced in some parts of the country, spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said.Ratau said the department was also calling on members of the society to adhere to water restrictions imposed by different municipalities in the province.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
