The department of labour will host an annual workshop and road show to promote the implementation and compliance with the Employment Equity Act in Bloemfontein on July 24.The department aims to share key information and provide a platform to stakeholders for engagement on matters based on the act.The theme of the road show and workshops will be: Real transformation make sbusiness sense.The department will also present information and help employers prepare their submission of employment equity (EE) reports online to the department for the 2017 reporting period.Topics that can be expected to be covered on the day include the publicising of the amended code of good practice on the preparation and implementation of the EE plans, as well as make public the 17th Commission for Employment Equity (CEE) annual report and the 2016 EE public register and present current CCMA cases on Employment Equity Act. The 17th Commission For Employment Equity report showed that the representation of the white group at top management level was 68.9% which is more than six times their economic active population (EAP).The situation was also the case with the Indian group at 8.6% as they have a representation of three times more than their EAP.The opposite is true for the African group at 14.3 and coloured group at 4.7%, as they are under-represented in relation to their EAP, a department statement said.These skewed demographics, the department said, is the same at senior management as well as skilled technical and professional level.Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant has told workers to ensure that they scrutinise the equity plans and reports before they are submitted to the department. For the third year in the running, the department of labour will also share the stage with the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in order to share information on dispute resolution and case law, the department said.People that are targeted for the workshops during the road show include human resources executives and practitioners, EE Forum members, assigned senior EE managers/transformation managers, academics and trade unions who among the many participants the department take the opportunity to attend.The department said it had received 741 employment equity reports out of more than 140000 employees resulting in 2.8% submitting reports.In the Free State 91.1% of Africans are the economically active population.The workplace profile at top management level by race in the province painted a grim image as only 17.3% of African males occupied positions in top management and 6.8% of African females were in these positions although the economically active population (EAP) in the province are Africans.While both white males and females in top management amount to more than 70%, their EAP sits at 6.4%. There is a high concentration of males in senior management.The white group is mostly represented within the private sector (63.4%) and educational institutions (59.2%), while the African group is employed in all spheres of the government and non-profit organisations, the CEE document said.The workplace profile at professionally qualified level shows that Free State has the highest representation of the white people (46.7%), this according to the document is concerning when considering the EAP distribution.TNA Reporterprovinces@thenewage.co.za
