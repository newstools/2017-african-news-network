There s been an increase of attacks on both Uber and Taxify drivers over the past months. Uber has called for an intervention by the authorities following weeks of violent attacks on its drivers. The incident was the latest in the series of violent attacks on Uber drivers.Numerous drivers have said they feared for their lives while others say they have been beaten up and their belongings including phones and laptops stolen. In other incidents, passengers have also been targeted. We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic news. Our hearts and thoughts are with his family during this difficult time and we will continue to offer our support, Uber Africa spokesperson Samantha Allenberg said. We are assisting the police with their investigation in every way possible. The technology company has called for the violent acts to stop, saying there is no excuse to use violence. We know that these actions do not represent the entire industry, however, this violence and intimidation against those who choose to use technology apps, like Uber, must stop, Allenberg said.Gauteng transport MEC Ismael Vadi recently revealed that the province was sitting with more than 40 criminal cases of arson, assault, damage to property, intimidation and theft relating to the turf war between Uber and metered taxis.Uber said as a security measure it had hired response teams in areas where drivers had reported acts of intimidation.
