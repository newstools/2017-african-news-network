News that a Saudi Arabian woman has been arrested for flouting the kingdom s dress code by wearing a miniskirt and crop top in a viral video, serves as a reminder to visitors to do their homework before travelling to conservative countries in the Middle East.In the video, which went viral at the weekend after first surfacing on Snapchat, a young, dark-haired woman is seen walking around the historic fort in Ushayqir in the ultra-conservative province of Najd in Saudi Arabia.The video stoked controversy on social media, with some calling for the woman s immediate arrest and others coming to her defence.But whether or not you support the woman s actions and audacity, travellers to conservative countries are advised to read up on local customs and abide by their laws.According to the US Department of state, women in Saudi Arabia customarily wear a full-length black cloak known as the abaya , and cover their heads with a scarf.Women who choose not to conform to the dress code are advised that they face possible detention and arrest.Likewise, men are advised to dress conservatively and not to wear shorts in public or go out shirtless. The department of state said that visitors were also subject to local laws.Those who violate the rules, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, imprisoned, subject to physical punishments, or even executed depending on the offence. Unlike Saudi Arabia, women travelling to the UAE are not expected to cover their heads or wear traditional Muslim dress, according to the Embassy of the UAE website for the US.When visiting a mosque however, women will be asked to respect Muslim traditions and wear an abaya to cover their heads.It s not just Saudi Arabia that enforces a strict dress code.As a traveller, it is important to understand appropriate clothing choices and acceptable behaviours expected from you in order to make your trip memorable. Here s a checklist of countries to consider before you book that air ticket:IranEarly last year, several female Air France flight attendants were told to wear headscarves upon arrival in Tehran.The order sparked a huge outrage, with some female cabin crew members demanding the right to opt-out of working on the Iranian Capital route.The current dress code for tourists in Iran outlines that Islamic codes of behaviour are strictly enforced to all visitors.When out in public places, women are required to cover their heads with a headscarf, wear trousers or a floor length skirt, and a long-sleeved tunic or coat that reaches to mid-thigh or knee. Men are required to wear long trousers and long-sleeve shirts.MoroccoAlthough in recent years Morocco has become a little relaxed depending on which part of the country you go to, women, especially when travelling alone, may be prone to unwanted attention.To avoid unnecessary stares, women are advised to dress modestly in long skirts and dresses, jeans or pants that cover the knees. Women generally wear sandals or loafers and would rarely wear heels. It s considered a sign of respect for your hosts to keep knees and shoulders covered. This goes for men, too, Telegraph Travel s Marrakech expert Paula Hardy said.A beautiful country with friendly people, some parts of Morocco such as Marrakech appear more liberal than others as Los Angeles blogger Lauren Salisbury, who travelled to Marrakech, came to learn. Truth be told, you could wear whatever you want in Marrakech. There s no dress code and women aren t required to wear scarves. But if you do dress like you are going to a beach in the French Riviera you will stick out and attract attention, she said.North KoreaIn the east Asian country, it s not only tourists who are kept on a tight rein.Citizens are also expected to dress conservatively or risk attracting unwanted attention from the so-called government fashion police .Last year, the government banned body piercings, jeans, pony tails and tight clothing as part of its latest crackdown on western culture with a growing number of North Koreans said to be infatuated with everything western.The crackdown came comes just months after it was reported that dictator Kim Jong-un was ordering men to copy his ambitious hair style, limiting growth to a maximum length of 2cm.However, the rules appear to have been somewhat relaxed in certain instances as long as you avoid shorts, sleeveless shirts or anything that exposes too much flesh.
