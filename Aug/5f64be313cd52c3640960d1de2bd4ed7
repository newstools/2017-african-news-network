DA coalition partners in the Nelson Mandela Bay might not support Mayor Athol Trollip&#8217;s move to remove deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani.Earlier it was reported that Trollip has signed up with Patriotic Alliance(PA) as a coalition partner in the Nelson Mandela Bay.The signing was after the continued infighting between Trollip and Bobani.According to the Herald Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, ACDP president, with the party contributing to one seat of the coalition said they refuse to support Bobani&#8217;s removal.Meshoe reported saying there was no consultation and they will not support it. We will not support it because from the beginning the multi-party government agreed to the need for consultation when dealing with serious matters such as this, he said.In June Trollip wrote a letter to the DA leader Mmusi Maimane and leader of the federal executive James Selfe.In the letter, Trollip described the relationship with deputy mayor Bobani as volatile and has become increasingly unsustainable.He expressed how PA was as determined as the DA and its other coalition partners, COPE and ACDP, not to allow the city to fall back into the hands of the ANC.Meshoe has blamed the uncertainty of the coalition to both Trollip and Bobani.He said they are impulsive and quick to make decisions without consulting their political principals. They do not want to give the leaders of political parties a chance to sit down and resolve this matter,&#8221; said Meshoe.It is reported that Mosiuoa Lekota COPE president whose party also contributes to one seat in the coalition said he too had not been consulted about the plan to get rid of Bobani.TNA Reporter
