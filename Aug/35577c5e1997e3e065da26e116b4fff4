Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has conceded that the mismanagement and irregularity related to government&#8217;s Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) contract have &#8220;tainted&#8221; National Treasury&#8217;s reputation but that not all hope should be lost.Gigaba was part of a Treasury team which briefed Parliaments Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the ill-fated IFMS project which has cost the taxpayer R1.09 billion with seemingly no benefits.&#8220;All of what happened should not erode the integrity of the nation in Treasury as an institution. This was one lapse in an institution that manages a whole range of huge programmes and finances of the state,&#8221; said Gigaba.Related: Treasury s can of wormsThe Minister said that Treasury would take stock of all that has gone wrong with IFMS including undertaking a forensic investigation.&#8220;It is our intention to get to the bottom of the matter. There was clearly a breakdown of internal controls which we will strive to restore,&#8221; he said.Earlier during the briefing, Director-General at National Treasury, Dondo Mogajane announced that he has stopped all IFMS related payments going forward.Mogajane also said he had elected to restructure the entire management team around the project.Related: Treasury s murky dealsMeanwhile, Gigaba today revealed that Treasury has requested the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) to institute an investigation against audit firm Deloitte to determine if its conduct was consistent with that required of an audit firm.According to the minister, the audit firm had requested a guarantee of future work to be provided by the department, while producing &#8220;shoddy&#8221; work.Earlier this year an ANN7 expos blew the lid on the mismanagement of Government s IFMS project.Related: ANN7 Expos -Treasury s catastrophic audit reportThe expose was based on an internal audit report which indicated that this office within the National Treasury was guilty of gross financial irregularities.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
