Ahead of the motion of no confidence in the President Jacob Zuma, leaders of opposition political parties, civil society groups, and trade unions will lead a march to Parliament in support to remove Zuma as the president.The scheduled march is expected to state parking lot outside Fabric City, Keizersgracht Street and end at Corner of Roeland Street and St Johns Road.&#8220;In the 100 months Jacob Zuma has been President of South Africa, he has stolen the people s money, broken our Constitution and his oath of office, and sold off our country to a small group of very wealthy individuals,&#8221; said DA Acting spokesperson Graham Charters.The march will include political parties DA, EFF, UDM, COPE, IFP, ACDP, VF+, APC, Agang, and AIC. Civil society groups including The Freedom Movement, OUTA, SaveSA, ZumaMustFall, and FutureSA will join, along with trade unions SAFTU and FEDUSA.Speaker of the National Assembly (NA) Baleka Mbete on Monday announced that voting on the motion of no confidence in the President would be by secret ballot after members of the NA debated the motion.&#8220;Ordinary South Africans now feel the damage caused by this captured man. The economy is falling apart, factories and mines are closing down, and thousands of people are losing their jobs,&#8221; said Charters.He added: &#8220;While the removal of Zuma will not solve every problem in our nation, it would be the beginning of a national rebuilding project that is urgently required. This is precisely the spirit that brought opposition parties and civil society together, to join hands with all patriotic South Africans who want to defend the future of their country&#8221;.-TNA Reporter
