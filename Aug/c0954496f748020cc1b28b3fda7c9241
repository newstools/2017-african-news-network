Initially, the conference was expected to take place in early May, but it was later postponed to this month.The incumbent chairperson Ace Magashule is for the first time going to be contested by his long-time ally and childhood friend Thabo Manyoni for the party s chairmanship.Manyoni said he was available to contest for provincial chairmanship as long as branches wanted him to contest. It is widely reported that Manyoni enjoys the support from the province s second biggest region Lejweleputswa and Motheo.He recently resigned as National Assembly member to focus on domestic politics, he said when he resigned.Meanwhile, Meeko says the provincial executive committee resolved to continue with political work and aim at continuing building and uniting the ANC.-Sipho Jack
