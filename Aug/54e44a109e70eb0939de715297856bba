A TRIO of local entrepreneurs are changing the narrative in rural Eastern Cape, turning their farms into business success stories.Wilfred Makaphela, Tamsanqa Mkumantela and Lawrence Maduna, farming in Sterkspruit, Maclear and Lady Grey respectively, have two things in common: a passion for farming and an understanding that there is no substitute for hard work.The province has enormous potential for agricultural growth but farmers there lack access to business, market information and finance.Maduna, Makaphela and Mkumantela were selected to participate in the Small Business Academy (SBA) development programme of the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB), offered jointly with the Joe Gqabi Economic Development Agency (JoGEDA), that also sponsored the programme.In its first year of the initiative, a group of 26 small business owners completed the programme. This includes owners of companies in industries such as catering, fashion, communication, security and cleaning services.The programme provides a platform for previously disadvantaged small business owners in Aliwal North, Sterkspruit, Lady Grey, Ugie and Maclear to gain business, financial and operational knowledge to grow and strengthen their businesses, create networking opportunities and offers a mentorship programme whereby each participant is matched with a USB MBA alumnus.The course covers training in general management, finance, marketing, computer skills, business plan development, to personal development, and practical workshops.Makaphela, a retired school principal, has been farming in Sterkspruit for the past 13 years. He grew up in Esiwonyeni and his father funded Wilfred s education through wool sheering and selling sheep and cattle. Farming has always been part of my life and when I started teaching I bought myself 10 sheep and some cattle, Makaphela said. Over the years my livestock grew to more than 25 cattle and I started renting out camps on privately owned farms.In 2004 I secured a loan from Landbank and bought 560ha of land and today my farm has expanded to 1041ha with the assistance from the department of rural development and land reform. He farms with Bonsmara cattle supplying agents Karen Beef and Sparta and he sells the cows to private households for traditional consumption and to abattoirs.He employs two permanent staff members and despite the many challenges of theft, veld fires and access to finance, his vision is to become the leading supplier of Bonsmara cattle. Mkumetela from Maclear, the most fertile land in the area, started piggery in 2015. I grew up on a farm and although my family were not commercial farmers but relied on subsistence farming, I developed a passion for farming and I knew that one day I would be a farmer. I rent 2ha from the Elundini municipality and sell my pigs to local butcheries, street vendors, restaurants and households. Maduna farms in Lady Grey and his livestock farm employs seven permanent staff members and 10 part-time workers.He hopes to extend his 771ha farm to 5000ha and plant lucerne to offer feed during periods of droughts caused by the unpredictable weather patterns in the region.THELMA NGOMA thelman@thenewage.co.za
