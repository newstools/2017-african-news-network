There is no concrete evidence of the KwaZulu-Natal Richards Bay woman who was reported to be found in Nigeria, her sister confirmed.On Tuesday the SABC reported that 23-year-old Mbali Gumede had been found alive in a hospital in Nigeria.According to the report, Gumede was kidnapped, put into a container and shipped to Nigeria.Gumede&#8217;s sister Tobo Mthembu said this report was false because there is no evidence that her sister is alive.&#8220;We haven&#8217;t found our sister, no one has located my sister yet and we told the SABC journalist that these are just rumours.&#8220;I received an inbox via Facebook messenger, saying that she is in Nigeria but anyone can use her account and pretend is it her, if we can only get proof that the messages are from her then we will be sure,&#8221; Mthembu said.Gumede went missing on the 5th of June when she went to the University of Zululand (UniZulu) to sort out her staff.According to the Messenger screen grabs, Gumede was abducted, drugged and woke up in Nigeria.The messages further claim that she was on her way to school when she got a lift and remembers a woman drugging her.&#8216;Admitting that she is in a hospital, has damaged cells in her body and is recovering very well.&#8217;Mthembu added that they cannot just go to the Department of International Relations because certain procedures need to be followed as this matter is under Police investigation.The Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesperson Nelson Kgwete said they have spoken to the South African consulate.&#8220;The consulate in Lagos have been instructed to locate the woman in hospitals and alert the officials in the hospital, once that has been done they will report to us about the details and the conditions in which the woman is in,&#8221; said Kgwete.Mthunzini Police station has confirmed that a case of a missing person has been opened but could not divulge more on the matter.TNA Reporter
