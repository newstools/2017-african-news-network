The report by Ernst &amp; Young paints a picture of rampant mismanagement, fraud and corruption. SAA has lost billions because of tender irregularities. It is clear that the SOE is being looted&#8221;.SAA has refused to increase wages for the majority of workers, including the cabin crew, ground staff, cargo staff, and technical staff, but it is willing to continue paying out generous packages to the pilots, who are white and male.Pilots at SAA are pampered and they receive lucrative benefits at the expense of the majority of workers.NUMSA has lodged a dispute through the CCMA and meditation on these and other issues will take place soon.&#8220;We hope to reach an agreement soon because if talks fail, then we may have to resort to a strike.
