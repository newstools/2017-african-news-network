A motion of no confidence is expected to be tabled against Nelson Mandela Bay Metro deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani.This is after the Patriotic Alliance (PA) said it has lost all the confidence the party had in Bobani. We have lost all confidence in deputy mayor. He needs to be removed in order to bring stability to the metro, his presence is not healthy for the municipality, the PA said.Earlier this year the Nelson Mandela Metro mayor Phillip Trollip and Bobani had clash personality clash, which in turn caused their working relationship to collapse.According to reports at the time, the report which was tabled revealed that both Trollip and Bombani had breached their coalition agreement in their exercise of power as well as in their attempt to resolve disputes.During the whole miscommunication, Democratic Alliance federal chairperson James Selfe said coalitions were always difficult to manage but everyone needs to have the will to make the coalition survive .-TNA Reporter
