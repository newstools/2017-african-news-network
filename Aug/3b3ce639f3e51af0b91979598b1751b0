The poor state of the N12 Bridge near Eldorado Park will soon become a thing of the past with local communities looking forward to economic spin-offs following the completion of a R10m facelift for the bridge.MEC for roads and transport, Ismail Vadi officially reopened the refurbished bridge yesterday, commonly known as the Kliptown Bridge to local residents.The bridge was constructed in the 1960s and serves as a critical link between Kliptown, Eldorado Park, Nancefield Industrial and the nearby informal settlement.Department of roads and transport spokesperson Melitah Madiba said the bridge would bring economic benefits to the nearby communities. Its closure had negatively affected local businesses. Local businesses along the N12 freeway near Eldorado Park can breathe a sigh of relief following the official re-opening of the bridge as traffic had to be diverted through other routes which proved to be costly and time-consuming, Madiba said.The bridge was declared unsafe for public use following structural damage by a truck carrying a load exceeding the permissible height restrictions which hit its top structure in 2015. The severe damage led to the closure of the bridge as it posed a serious risk to motorists and pedestrians, Madiba said.Vadi called on motorists especially drivers and owners linked to the freight truck industry to obey the rules of the road in order to preserve road infrastructure and reduce risks to other road users. The damage to this bridge is another example of how overloading of freight trucks and disregard for height restrictions continue to cause untold damage to our road infrastructure, Vadi said.news@thenewage.co.za
