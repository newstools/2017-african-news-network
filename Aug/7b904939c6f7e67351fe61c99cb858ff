The Democratic Alliance has on Wednesday called for an inquiry into how Zimbabwe&#8217;s first lady Grace Mugabe was able to leave the country when she was clearly an identified suspect in a criminal charge.Police Minister Fikile Mbalula had on Tuesday confirmed that Mugabe had handed herself over to the South African Police Service (SAPS) and was expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate s court.While a number of journalists waited for Grace Mugabe to appear in court facing a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, it was reported that she was back in Harare to join her husband for Defence Forces Day Celebrations.&#8220;We especially need clarity on whether she had VIP protection assigned to her and if so, whether the SAPS, therefore, took her to her plane.&#8220;Mbalula clearly missed something as he is quoted as saying that she was not under arrest&#8217; because she cooperated and handed herself over to the police. That is cooperation, more than any necessity to go and arrest a person,&#8221; said DA Shadow Minister of Police Zakhele Mbhele.Mbhele indicated that whether or not Grace committed to handing herself over, the SAPS should have done their job and arrested her, as they would any other ordinary person accused of the same crime.&#8220;It was grossly irresponsible for the SAPS not to arrest the Zimbabwean first lady who can easily access private air travel, thus posing a flight risk. SAPS should have reasonably known that she was never going to hang around to show up in court,&#8221; said Mbhele.Meanwhile, Ngqabutho Mabhena, the general secretary of the Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZPC) said Mugabe was a violent person. In Zimbabwe, we call Grace Dr Stop It because she conducts herself in a violent manner. Recently while in Dubai, she assaulted a journalist and violently grabbed her phone and threw it into a fish pond.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
