North West Premier and ANC chairperson Supra Mahumapelo says President Jacob Zuma has done an extremely good job, despite having many detractors.Mahumapelo said this on Thursday in Klerksdorp at the ANC cadre s forum which is scheduled to be addressed by Presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.He told scores of ANC supporters who attended the gathering that there is no need to remove President Zuma as his term of office was about to end, but rather be given a farewell as he is only left with a few months as president. President Zuma has done sterling work for South Africa despite a barrage of attacks against him. There is no reason for wanting to remove Zuma as he is already on his way out, he said.Mahumapelo added that there were some people who find it hard to sleep as they are worried about the outcomes of the ANC national congress. On the 18 of December, the party will have a new president and that person will definitely be a woman.On what could be seen as his effort to substantiate the statement, North West Premier said most men are raised by a woman and they should be given equal opportunities. Men including Zuma were raised by a woman, they play a big role and should be given equal opportunities. We are constructing a non-sexist society,&#8221; he emphasised.Mahumapelo also said that the woman s league wasn t asking for something that didn t exist in the policies of the ANC by wanting Dlamini-Zuma as the party s next President.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;
