Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to step in on Wednesday to prevent tensions with Jordan spiralling into a brawl between two lawmakers who agreed to meet on the border.Oren Hazan, from Netanyahu&#8217;s Likud party, had accepted a challenge from Jordanian MP Yahya al-Saud to meet near the main crossing between the two countries on Wednesday morning, with fears of a fistfight.Netanyahu&#8217;s office said in a statement they had called Hazan &#8220;to order him not to go to the Allenby Crossing.&#8221;Hazan told military radio he approached the border but did not cross on Netanyahu&#8217;s orders.&#8220;The Israeli MP is a coward, he retreated,&#8221; Saud said according to a video published by Jordanian media.Saud had travelled to the border in anticipation of the meeting and said he was &#8220;doing this for Jordanian people to express our anger.&#8221;Jordan is one of only two Arab states to have signed a formal peace treaty with Israel, but the neighbours have been involved in weeks of spats over new security measures installed at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem.While Israel considers Jerusalem its undivided capital, Jordan claims authority over Al-Aqsa and the new checkpoints, introduced after an attack at the site, provoked huge protests.On July 23 Hazan tweeted that Israel protected Jordan&#8217;s &#8220;asses&#8221; and the country needed &#8220;reeducation,&#8221; apparently sparking a rebuke on Twitter.Both MPs have long histories of controversy.Hazan was suspended in 2015 from his position as deputy speaker of Israel&#8217;s parliament after a televised report accused him of involvement in pimping and drugs.He was also suspended for one month from any parliamentary activity in December 2015 after &#8220;insulting&#8221; behaviour towards a colleague with a disability.In May he was heavily criticised after taking a selfie with US President Donald Trump as he landed in Israel.In response Hazan told Israeli media he was often referred to as the &#8220;Israeli Trump.&#8221;Saud meanwhile has physically fought with a number of parliamentary colleagues in recent years.
