Veteran anti-apartheid and community activist Zackie Achmat has declared that civil society has nothing to do with two politically inspired marches due to take place in Cape Town on Tuesday.The marches, one organised by the ANC s Dullah Omar region and other groups that include several opposition parties including the DA and EFF, will take place on the day when a no-confidence debate against President Jacob Zuma is scheduled in the National Assembly.The ANC march will be pro-Zuma while the other is opposed to him.At a press conference yesterday, Achmat said that, unlike the two other processions to Parliament, #Unitebehind, an umbrella body of civil society organisations that represent the working class, would march on Monday night. Our march is non-party political. We need to ensure that anyone is welcome on the march. This is a people s march. We support it. We hope South Africa will stand behind it. We fully support the two-hour shut down planned for the next day, he said.Achmat, whose Treatment Action Campaign had played a decisive role in Thabo Mbeki s government changing its policy on antiretroviral drugs, said #Unitebehind was unashamedly working class in its orientation. It also accepted working class leadership.#Unitebehind, he said, wanted a people s march , where the voices of pensioners, farm workers, could be heard.dennisc@thenewage.co.za
