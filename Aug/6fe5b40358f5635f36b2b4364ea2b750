Two young men from humble beginnings, with one eye on the future and the other on the present, have ventured into local chemical manufacturing and supply.The North West-born founder of Solvent Distillers, Ofentse Lekoma, started his business late last year to pioneer and break the stereotype that black-owned companies can t be leaders in the field. We saw the opportunity with a huge amount of chemical (solvent) waste that gets generated by industries and laboratories, that gets disposed of or untreated. We considered the fact that this would contribute to the re-industrialisation of SA while reducing the high levels of unemployment, Lekoma said.Co-founder Mlungisi Magubane said Lekoma s mission and vision were to also be a global giant in a solvent and fine chemical production, distribution and supply and aimed to transform the chemical landscape.All businesses are known to have a niche and Solvent s recycling service is designed to help reduce clients liquid waste disposal expense.Lekoma said what made the business different from other similar businesses was that recycling and reusing recycled chemical solvents can be a huge economic benefit to potential customers. Our Solvent recycling service is designed to help reduce our clients liquid waste disposal expense, thus providing a huge economic benefit. Clients give us their waste (solvent chemicals), we distil or purify it and then sell it back to them at a very cheap price. That s a massive cost-cutting for our clients. We collect, transport, treat and distil our clients solvent waste, return it to the client or sell it to a new buyer. He said his passion was to nurture the business and grow a living entity to develop it to its fullest potential and ultimately dominate the local industry.Lekoma said their customers tended to come back and use his services because the company always seeks to offer tailor-made solutions to its customers and take waste solvent and process it to meet the client s specifications. Once their waste is distilled, it would be nearly impossible to distinguish it from pure new solvents.The solvent is incubated at The Innovation Hub, owned by the Gauteng provincial government, which houses high-technology and innovation-driven companies in the bioscience and advanced manufacturing sectors.KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE
