We condemn this barbaric act in the harshest of terms and call on the law enforcement authorities to act swiftly to bring the criminals to book.Chabalala has been instrumental in uncovering widespread corruption and the lack of service delivery in the Emfuleni Local Municipality and has worked tirelessly to grow the DA in the region, the party said on Saturday.The DA labelled the incident as a sign of growing intolerance within the current political climate. The party says it will request proactive updates on this case from Gauteng Provincial Police Commissioner.The DA further passed its support to the family, friends and his loved ones.-TNA Reporter
