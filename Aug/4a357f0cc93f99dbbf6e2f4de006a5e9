The Chamber of Mines has accused the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) of going ahead with the Minister Mosebenzi Zwane&#8217;s proposed moratorium despite the closing date for comments on the proposal being tomorrow.Zwane proposed a moratorium on the granting of any new applications for prospecting or mining rights and the processing of applications for the renewal of prospecting or mining rights until the finalisation of the court challenges against the new mining charter (Mining Charter 3)&#8221; The actions of the DMR Minister, first with the unilateral development and release of the Reviewed Mining Charter on 15 June 2017 and now with the implementation of this moratorium, shows scant regard for the viability of the mining sector, sustaining employment and the national interest. The Minister should withdraw the notice and not apply any moratorium,&#8221; said the Chamber in a statement.An urgent interdict application to prohibit the implementation of the moratorium is scheduled to be heard in the High Court tomorrow.The Chamber has criticised the proposed moratorium saying it will cost investment in the sector and ultimately lead to further job losses in the sector.&#8220;This demonstrates the DMR leadership s disregard for the crisis facing the mining sector and the negative implications that a moratorium may have on the viability of struggling mining companies and the jobs that could be lost as a direct consequence,&#8221; the chamber said.The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Tuesday reiterated that it was also against the proposed moratorium. We will urge the Department of Minerals to desist from implementing the envisaged moratorium with immediate effect as the move will definitely be found wanting by the court of law, as it deviates from the principles and objectives of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act 2002, said NUM general secretary David Sipunzi.Zwane has previously asserted that the moratorium is not by the department&#8217;s design but rather a consequence of the chambers interdict against mining charter. It&#8217;s only logical that if we pause on this charter, we pause on issues that will affect the charter. I have signed a notice of putting a moratorium on them so that we level the playing field while we wait for the court, said Zwane speaking on ANN7.-TNA Reporter
