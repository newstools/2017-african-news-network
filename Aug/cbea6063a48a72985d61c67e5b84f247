PRETORIA residents, through an event hosted by Justflipit charity drive, raised funds to help five-month-old baby boy Janhu Hamelink to undergo an operation after being born with a cleft lip and palate.Event organiser Corni van der Merwe said the boy born with a cleft lip and palate had already undergone one operation but still had to undergo a further five or six operations. The boy s family trains at my facility at the school and after the birth of their son, the father and I discussed the disability their son was born with and he mentioned that they had to sell some of their assets to afford the first of many operations that he had to undergo, Van der Merwe said.She said they told her that their medical aid would not cover a large amount for his operations, claiming the operations to be cosmetic and she decided to help the family. I felt that I should do what I can to assist the Hamelink family. We had already done a previous event Pedalthon a year before which was very successful, but now I wanted to involve more of the community, Van Der Merwe said.She said the boy struggled to eat and drink and his sucking ability was impeded which would affect his speech when he started to talk. With this operation, the second 50% of his palate and his upper gum will be enclosed. They will work on his split lip and his nose will also be operated on to give it a more rounded look, Van Der Merwe said.She said about 180 people took part in the event and raised R50000 from donations, sponsors, participants and vendor stalls, in aid of the operation scheduled for tomorrow. This operation will aid him forming a vacuum in his mouth so that he can be able to suck instead of losing everything through his nostrils. This in turn will aid him in his speech development, Van Der Merwe said.She said any person born with a disability could not be blamed or ridiculed for their affliction and others should do whatever they could to help them.ANGEL MAHLOnews@thenewage.co.za
