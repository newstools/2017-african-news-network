THE Deputy Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, attended the Eastern Cape Young Women Summit, leading a dialogue under the theme ICTs for women empowerment.The dialogue took place during the summit hosted by transport, safety and liaison MEC Weziwe Tikana.The summit was aimed at facilitating enterprise development and ensuring that district and local municipalities adopt young women empowerment programmes.Abrahams said she had been deeply troubled by the rise of social ills such as the dependency on blessers, who prey on young girls, luring them into disarray under the disguise of a better life which is driven by material possessions. It is equally concerning to note the increase in teenage pregnancy, school drop outs, drugs and alcohol dependence and the prevalence of HIV-Aids among young people, Abrahams said. I, therefore, call upon young women in this auditorium to join me in saying #Blessers Must Fall! She said the department had prioritised the empowerment of women in the ICT sector. We have programmes such as the ICT SMME support strategy, techno girl, mobinet and ICT dialogues among many others. The department s approach in this regard is to ensure that 30% of procurement is set aside to benefit SMMEs, youth and women to accelerate the development of sustainable small enterprises.We also have the techno-girl which is a mentorship programme conducted in partnership with Telkom and has been implemented in Gauteng and Port Elizabeth, Abrahams said. She said going forward similar programmes would be rolled out in other provinces.The programme targets high achieving 15 to 18-year-old school girls from disadvantaged communities, especially those coming from rural areas, to make informed career choices with an emphasis on science, technology and engineering.Techno-girl further places disadvantaged girls in a structured job shadowing programme in the participating provinces and exposes them to the work environment to enable them to make informed career choices.Abrahams said the department hosts young women and ICT dialogues from time to time which were aimed at encouraging young girls to participate in technology fields and to increase digital literacy among girls.
