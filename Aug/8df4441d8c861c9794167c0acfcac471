United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa has issued an unequivocal ultimatum to the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, to reinstate axed deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani or else they will walk away from their coalition government.&#8220;If they don&#8217;t reinstate Bobani we are out of the coalition in Port Elizabeth, we will continue in other areas,&#8221; said Holomisa on Friday morning.Bobani was removed yesterday after sixty councillors voted him out in a motion of no confidence vote.In the statement, the councillors said they did so because Bobani consistently voted against the coalition government made up of the DA, UDM, COPE and ACDP.Bobani and DA Executive Mayor Athol Trollip have been at loggerheads for a long time with Bobani accused of maladministration an allegation Holomisa has strongly denied.&#8220;This noise of maladministration we have been hearing it for some time and we said bring evidence and table it in the council and if Bobani is implicated in anything we will remove him,&#8221; he said.However, Holomisa adds that an investigation initiated by the coalition was not conclusive in proving maladministration by the UDM Councillor but Trollip kept &#8220;bombarding&#8221; them with accusations but has yet to prove.Holomisa said that as it was evident that the two men will not be able to work alongside each other, coalition leaders would possibly have to show both of them the door.&#8220;But we will not accept when the DA wants to take a unilateral decision to say your counsellor must obey the mayor of the DA even if the difference is based on principle,&#8221; said Holomisa.However, Mayor Athol Trollip immediately hit back at the UDM leader saying he would not be going anywhere as the DA had won the most votes in the municipality during last year Local Government elections.&#8220;This has nothing to do with personalities. It&#8217;s one destructive person acting against the coalition and all the other coalition partners have supported us and written to the other leaders that the destructive element is Mr Bobani,&#8221; he said.Trollip repeated that Bobani has systematically voted against the coalition and collaborated with the ANC.&#8220;It&#8217;s like having a partner having an affair but they are living in the same house as you,&#8221; Trollip said.Trollip added that they have reported the state of affairs for eight months and Holomisa refuses to do nothing against his counsellor who votes against the coalition.&#8220;Every time we bring that to the attention of General Holomisa he ignores that&#8230;it is the worst kind of contravention of the co-governance agreement,&#8221; he said.-Siphiwe Mchunu
