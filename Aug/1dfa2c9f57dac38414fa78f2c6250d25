WALTER Sisulu University (WSU) has vowed that the student who had R14m mistakenly deposited into her account will be held liable after allegedly spending more than R818000 and not R40000 as earlier reported.University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo confirmed that the payment was made about five months ago through an error by the company administrating NSFAS funds for WSU.The payment came to light after pictures of the student partying and living large started doing the rounds.Tukwayo said there were specific merchants where students were able to use the money to buy books and food so the university would investigate how the student was able to buy some of the goods she bought. There have been previous cases where merchants have colluded with students but this will be part of the investigation.She will be held liable to pay back the money she has spent, she said. Students on financial aid receive money for books and food. It was callous that she did not report the matter immediately. She will definitely be held responsible, she said.Tukwayo said the university was meeting with the CEO of the company administering the student debit cards, called Intellicard and that the university s forensic team would also look into the matter. It was not a NSFAS mistake.It was an Intellicard mistake and we are not sure how that happened. Late yesterday, a Twitter account in the name of Sibongile Mani, reportedly the beneficiary of the mistaken payment, had social media abuzz, as the post claimed that she had been told by officials from the university not to report the payment a day after it went into her account.The New Age was unable to verify whether the account is indeed hers.LILLIAN SELAPISA AND LONDEKA DLAMINI
