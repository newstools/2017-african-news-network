Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa&#8217;s office has today confirmed that he will not attend the upcoming fifth Marikana Massacre commemoration.&#8220;Reports to the effect that Deputy President Ramaphosa has indicated his intention to visit Marikana on the anniversary are incorrect,&#8221; said the acting spokesperson for the Deputy President, Tyrone Seale, in a statement.This comes after the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) president, Joseph Mathunjwa yesterday said he had met with widows of the slain miners on Wednesday and they made it clear that Ramaphosa was not welcome in Marikana. Yesterday we had a meeting with the widows and members and they have made it clear Cyril Ramaphosa was not welcome at the koppie on August 16, Mathunjwa said.Related: Ramaphosa not welcome at Marikana 5th anniversary: widow&#8217;sHe said this during his briefing on the state of the economy, labour issues and a preview of the fifth Marikana commemoration.The Presidency today, however, said that Ramaphosa remains committed to being part of an initiative proposed by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.Ramaphosa earlier this year expressed his willingness to speak to the windows of the mine workers after Madikizela-Mandela advised him to go to Marikana.&#8221; The feelings and wishes of the Marikana community and the families of the victims are of paramount importance in this sensitive process,&#8221; added Seale.Yesterday Mathunjwa also accused Ramaphosa of only wanting to come to Marikana to further his presidential ambitions. In future, if he wants to visit Marikana then he can consult the relevant doors, Mathunjwa said.Related: Marikana activist hits at RamaphosaEvery year on August 16 thousands of mine workers from the North West gather at Wonderkop hill in remembrance of 33 miners who died at the hands of the police during a wage strike in 2012.-TNA Reporter
