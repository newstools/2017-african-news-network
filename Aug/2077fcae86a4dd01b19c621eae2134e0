This programme continues to honour the efforts and contribution of women, young females and women with disabilities for the role they play in food security, poverty alleviation, job creation and economic growth in the sector, he said.The awards on Sunday honour the overall winners in a number of categories such as best female worker, best subsistence producer and top entrepreneurs on export, among others.The ceremony will be held under the theme of Proclaiming progress towards women s empowerment.Agriculture, land reform and rural development MEC Norman Shushu said at the provincial awards a fortnight ago that his department was emancipating women in the province with the focus of sustaining them in the formerly male dominated sector. When we as a democratically elected government dedicate the month of August to women. We are not doing this because it has become fashionable to pay lip service but to recognise women, Shushu said. We are doing this because women have played a pivotal role in the struggle to bring about this freedom. We can only arrive at the total emancipation of women when we have addressed the three contradictions in their interrelatedness, the contradictions of class, race and gender. Shushu recently said the country could not rest when there was gender inequality and women were not experiencing economic emancipation. We cannot rest when women have no means of living. We want to say our government remains committed to enhance the policy we have put in place for gender equality and the total emancipation of women. We do not only want gender to be represented but also want adequate empowerment to be created for women to participate in all spheres of the economy, he said.Shushu applauded the women in the sector who had made it and created jobs, especially in remote areas.Shushu said in total, 263 women received support from his department, as they worked towards emancipating women.He said with the mining sector slowly losing its momentum, it was now agriculture that was going to create job opportunities.The African Farmers Association of South Africa representative, Sehularo Sehularo, applauded the department for empowering women.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
