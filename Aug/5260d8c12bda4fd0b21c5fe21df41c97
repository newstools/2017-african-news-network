Amid a worrying increase in school violence and in preparation for the 2017 matric examinations King Goodwill Zwelithini has decided to play a role in boosting morale in the province s education sector.He will embark on a series of meetings with principals in the province today and will be joined by the MEC for education, Mthandeni Dlungwane and senior officials from his department.The first engagement will take place in Ulundi today, where the king is expected to raise concerns about spiralling number of incidents of pupil violence, some of which have come to light on video footage which went viral on social media.Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa, said the first round of meetings would be attended by more than 700 high school principals from the Zululand and Amajuba districts. The meetings will involve role players from across the spectrum from underprivileged to well-equipped schools, performing to non-performing schools, urban and rural.He said the chairpersons of school governing bodies (SGBs) will also attend the series of meetings and that the engagements would be rolled out to other districts as well. His majesty king Goodwill Zwelithini Zulu and MEC Dlungwana will also use the opportunity to promote the non-negotiables in education such as the requirement that teachers must be in school, in class, on time, teaching, with no neglect of duty and no abuse of pupils. Equally important, children should be in class, on time, learning, be respectful of their teachers and each other and do their homework. Discussions will also focus on how to improve matric results in the province, he said.Mthethwa said the development of strong partnerships to promote effective learning and teaching in schools will also be discussed. The MEC will share his vision for quality education. He will want to hear from school principals what can be done to improve the quality of learning and teaching and to strengthen partnerships that will take education and skills development to a higher level in the province, he said.The initiative comes at a time when the province has pledged to improve the matric pass rate, which despite an improvement of 7.9% last year from 61.6% in 2015, remained among the third worst performing provinces in the country.SIHLE MAVUSOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
