Georgia reacted furiously on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Moscow-backed separatist region of Abkhazia on the anniversary of the outbreak of a brief war between Tbilisi and Moscow.Putin visited the Black Sea resort town of Pitsunda in Abkhazia for talks with the leader of the self-proclaimed country, Raul Khajimba, on the ninth anniversary of the start of the war on August 8, 2008.Georgia&#8217;s foreign ministry condemned Putin&#8217;s visit to what it called an occupied region as a &#8220;cynical action,&#8221; saying it represented a continuation of Moscow&#8217;s &#8220;deliberate policy against Georgia&#8221;.It urged Moscow to cease &#8220;provocative actions&#8221; and called on the international community to respond to Russia&#8217;s &#8220;aggressive steps.&#8221;Abkhazia is internationally recognised as part of ex-Soviet Georgia but Russia sees it as a separate country &#8212; along with another region, South Ossetia &#8212; following the brief war with Georgia.Moscow has thousands of troops stationed in the two breakaway regions in what Georgia calls a military &#8220;occupation&#8221;, and supports them financially.In televised comments, Putin stressed that Russia &#8220;firmly guarantees the security and self-sufficiency of Abkhazia, its independence. I am sure that this will continue in the future.&#8221;He described Russia&#8217;s military base, which is shared with Abkhazian forces, as crucial to security in the region.&#8220;The united Russian base on Abkhazia&#8217;s territory continues to play a key role in providing stability in the region,&#8221; Putin said.Khajimba, like Putin, is a former officer in the Soviet-era KGB spy agency. He was elected president of Abkhazia in 2014 and shortly afterwards signed a strategic partnership deal with Moscow that formalised Russian dominance in the tiny separatist region.Putin&#8217;s visit came after two Russian tourists in Abkhazia were killed and dozens injured by an explosion at a munitions depot earlier this month. The region is popular with Russians as a cut-price holiday destination.&#8211; Belarus &#8216;annexation&#8217;? &#8211;Meanwhile the exiled former leader of Georgia warned of more potential Russian dominance, saying Moscow could be preparing to annex neighbouring Belarus.&#8220;I think Russia is preparing for takeover and annexation of Belarus,&#8221; Mikheil Saakashvili told AFP in a telephone interview Tuesday during a visit to Lithuania&#8217;s capital Vilnius.A vocal Kremlin critic, stripped of both his Georgian and Ukrainian citizenship, he added that Russian military infrastructure deployed in Belarus for September&#8217;s massive &#8220;Zapad&#8221; (West) manoeuvres &#8220;could be used for that at any time&#8221;.NATO states have expressed concern over Moscow&#8217;s upcoming drills in Belarus and Kaliningrad, Russia&#8217;s westernmost outpost, but have not suggested the Kremlin has designs on Minsk.&#8220;Russia may be interested in having a full-fledged military base in Belarus, but an annexation means it would lose one of its last loyal allies and increase tensions with the West,&#8221; said Laurynas Jonavicius, a Vilnius University analyst.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Moscow needs that,&#8221; he added.Saakashvili was Georgia&#8217;s president during the short war with Russia that saw his small military routed in just five days.The charismatic reformer came to power in Georgia&#8217;s 2003 Rose Revolution but then fell from grace and is now wanted by Georgian prosecutors on charges of abuse of office during his nine-year rule that he insists are politically motivated.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko meanwhile called his Georgian counterpart Giorgi Margvelashvili to voice his &#8220;solidarity&#8221; on the anniversary of &#8220;the start of the aggression on Georgia&#8217;s territorial integrity,&#8221; according to a statement from the Ukraine leader&#8217;s office.&#8220;Our hearts are with you,&#8221; said Poroshenko, whose country saw its Crimea peninsula annexed by Moscow in March 2014, and which remains gripped by a pro-Russian insurgency in the east.-AFP
