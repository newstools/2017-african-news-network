A teacher from Willowmead High School in Lenasia who was accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a teenage pupil has resigned.The Gauteng department of education said the teacher quit after receiving a suspension letter and disciplinary action.The education department launched an investigation in March after images circulated on social media showing the man kissing the young girl.Department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said the teacher s resignation meant he could not be employed at any other school. He will be deemed to have been dismissed for misconduct and he will be blocked on the system, so he will not be able to be employed in the department. This teacher took a big risk by not defending himself, he said.The department said it was up to the pupil s parents to open a criminal case against the teacher.Both the teacher and the pupil s mother had denied they were in a relationship, claiming the pictures on social media were fake and had been manipulated using Photoshop.Earlier this year, another high school teacher from Lenasia was accused of sexually harassing a 14-year-old pupil.The mother of the girl claimed the teacher, who didn t teach her daughter, had been making sexual advances towards the teen since last year.The teenager s mother said her daughter had come home from school crying in February.She told her mother that a male teacher had interrupted another teacher s lesson, asking to see the pupil in another room.The mother claimed that once they were alone, the 47-year-old teacher asked the Grade 10 pupil whether she was still a virgin. When they were alone in an office, he asked her whether she s still a virgin and continued to say virgins were what he wanted. Sometimes he bought her food and told her to bunk school so she could visit him at his house, the mother said.She said the teacher wanted to have sex with her daughter in return but the girl refused.Bodibe said the department was considering placing the teacher on precautionary suspension while officials investigated. The department of education can confirm that it is investigating a case of sexual harassment against a teacher. We are disgusted as the department to learn that yet another teacher at a high school in Lenasia is being accused of misconduct towards a pupil, he said.He warned that the department would not tolerate such behaviour and would not hesitate to take stern action against teachers who abuse their authority.CALLYN MARKSnews@thenewage.co.za
