African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Chairperson in the Free State Thabo Manyoni says he is disappointed at the level of intolerance within the ANC in the province.This is after, a group of people believed to be ANC members wanted to disrupt the meeting he had with the community of Dewetsdorp. I, however, need to express my disappointment to note that within our very own movement we still have some who call themselves revolutionaries and yet they don&#8217;t have tolerance and always want to remote or control our people.&#8220;In the language of our own, it is undemocratic, opportunistic and anti-revolutionary to intimidate and disrupt gatherings or meetings of other people; this is very simple, if you do not agree with other people s views or preference Just Stay or walk away, Manyoni added.He said the ANC he grew up in and knows, it has taught him to be tolerant of the views especially of those who were not in agreement with, saying that the ANC has also taught him to accept criticisms and self-criticism.Manyoni is likened to be supporting the Current deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to take up the party s Presidency on the upcoming National elective congress, which is scheduled to be held at Gallagher Estate in Midrand Johannesburg.The provincial deputy chairperson is also earmarking to contest the provincial chairmanship in the upcoming provincial congress.Manyoni is set to contest the provincial long serving chairman Ace Magashule, and it&#8217;s been said that he is enjoying the support from one of the biggest regions in the province Lejweleputswa and Motheo region where he was an Executive Mayor in Mangaung Metro Municipality before being removed.Meanwhile, Manyoni told his supporters that political tolerance needed to start in the ANC before it can be preached to outside organisations. I have therefore a straight message to those who are busy unleashing comrades to go and disrupt, intimidate and destroy other comrades activities and events that, no amount of intimidation shall stop us from expressing our views anywhere and everywhere, our people are continuously resisting these rogue tendencies,&#8221; he said.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;
