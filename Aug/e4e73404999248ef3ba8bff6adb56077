A PRECEDENT could be set for indiscipline in the ranks of the ANC should MPs who defy party resolutions in Parliament be let off the hook, ANC Youth League president Collen Maine said yesterday.Maine was adamant the ANC should act decisively against those guilty of disciplinary infractions in the party. If we don t act, we ll lose the essence of organisational governance, he told the New Age yesterday. His comments came in the wake of a fallout in the ANC triggered by the recent no-confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma in Parliament in which a group of ANC MPs voted with the opposition.Maine said ANC MPs such as Makhosi Khoza, Derek Hanekom, Mondli Gungubele and Pravin Gordhan had dug their own graves by going public about how they had voted.In the aftermath of the vote, secretary-general Gwede Mantashe moved to tighten the noose around Hanekom and gave him a 10-day ultimatum to explain why he should not be fired as the party s disciplinary committee chair.Maine vowed that the youth league would continue to pile pressure on those who publicly backed the motion to remove Zuma from office. These comrades can t factionalise the organisation to the point that you can t deal with indiscipline when it rears its ugly head, he said.The SACP, has however, lashed out at the ANC over the application of inconsistent disciplinary sanctions against party members. Maine, referred to the ANC s upcoming December elective conference, when he acknowledged that the square-up between Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana DlaminiZuma was sowing deep-seated divisions in the party. The ANC is the leader of the alliance, it can t be that every time we go to a congress, we are fighting each other, lambasting each other in public, thinking you are impressing a faction, he said.bonolos@thenewage.co.za
