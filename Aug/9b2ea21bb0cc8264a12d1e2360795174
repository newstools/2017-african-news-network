Minister of Small Business Development Lindiwe Zulu has distanced herself from the media reports on rape allegations. This comes after City Press newspaper reported that minister&#8217;s close friend, Sazi Fakude , has been accused of raping a young woman.The newspaper reported that businessman Fakude took a 25 -year -old woman from a Sandton nightclub to his place in Kempton Park without her consent. It reported that after arriving a home Fakude became violent when she called her friends to fetch her.Zul u is concern ed about the way City Press dragged her name into the story. This story has absolutely nothing to do with Minister Zulu. City Press mentions Minister Zulu as a close friend of the man involved in the alleged rape. It is obvious that the intention of the newspaper was to cast aspersions on the integrity of Minister Zulu generally, as well as on her commitment to women s rights, in particular, said a statement from her office.The office of the minister said that Zulu does not support violence against women. Minister Zulu s record as a gender activist and passionate advocate for women s rights speaks for itself. Minister Zulu has never, and will never support any kind of abuse against women. In this particular case, Minister Zulu has confidence in the country s law enforcement agencies and our justice system to handle this matter appropriately. The law must be allowed to take its course, concludes the statement.
