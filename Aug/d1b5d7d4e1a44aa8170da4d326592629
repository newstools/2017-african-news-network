Well after he hooted repeatedly I opened my window and asked him what was his problem. He thereafter started calling me a p*** and a K*** of a black person.&#8220;He continued to call me a Zuma Agent, it got heated when he called me by the &#8216;K&#8217; word. I asked him why he called me by this, he then pulled out a stick from the back of his car and started swinging at me in an attempt to beat me violently,&#8221; said Sipunzi.Meanwhile, KFC store manager who was on duty during the incident Siphamandla Phushela confirmed that there was a heated argument between the two customers.&#8220;I went outside to try and talk to them but I could see that the argument was too violent as they were busying swearing, I decided to call the security to come help me,&#8221; said Phushela.He added that the white customer had a stick in his hand and he wanted to hit everyone, so he was forced to call an alternative security company for help.This video was uploaded by the victim on his Facebook page: Warning: This video contains strong languagehttps://www.facebook.com/piko.sipunzi/videos/pcb.1352951751485860/1352934788154223/?type=3&#038;theater&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/piko.sipunzi/videos/pcb.1352951751485860/1352935808154121/?type=3&#038;theater&nbsp;-TNA Reporter
