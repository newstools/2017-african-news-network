As the anticipated cold front hit South Africa yesterday, parts of the Eastern Cape were inaccessible after at least three mountain passes were closed off due to snowfall.The South African Weather Services has warned that snowfall, heavy rains, and strong winds are likely to continue today.Forecaster Mbavhi Maliage said the Wapadsberg Pass R61 between Cradock and Lootsberg, Lootsberg Pass N9 between Middelburg and Graaff Reniet and Barkly Pass R58 between Elliot and Barkly East were closed due to snow and will only be opened once the snow has cleared. There are also some areas declared hazardous due to the snow and people should be mindful of those areas. Places in the high-lying central and eastern interior will experience temperatures below 10 c. Most of the snowfall will be over the Eastern Cape, including the southern-western parts of KwaZulu-Natal and they may experience heavy rains which may lead to localized flooding, Maliage said. We are expecting light snow in the evening. After yesterday s cold front, temperatures in Gauteng are set to rise slightly. Temperatures in Gauteng will remain cool with maximum temperatures with Pretoria at 17 C, Johannesburg 15 C and Vereeniging 14 C with no possibilities of rain. Going into the weekend, we can expect partly cloudy conditions with no rainfall. Maliage said while the snowfall and the cold front persists in parts of the country, people should avoid driving in the dark. We advise people to keep warm and stay indoors. They should also avoid driving in the evening. People should remain cautious when driving as the roads can be slippery and icy at this point, so people should avoid routes that are declared unsafe or restricted. provinces@thenewage.co.za
