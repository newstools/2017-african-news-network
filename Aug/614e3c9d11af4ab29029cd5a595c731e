KwaZulu-Natal ANCYL has demanded answers on which ANC MPs voted in favour of the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Speaking at the Economic Freedom Lecture on Land and Minerals at the Durban University of Technology yesterday, Thanduxolo Sabela ANCYL provincial secretary said ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe must conduct an Investigation, News24 reported.&#8220;Mantashe must &#8220;swiftly&#8221; investigate which 26 MPs voted in favour of the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma &#8220;because all MPs know that voting against your own party is a dismissible offence&#8221;.This comes after President Jacob Zuma survived the vote of no confidence tabled against him by opposition parties. The vote was conducted through a secret ballot.Sabela portrayed those who voted in favor of the opposition parties as &#8220;suicide bombers&#8221;.He said the ANC could act as if they didn&#8217;t see that there were 26 suicide bombers within their ranks.Last week 198 MPs voted no to the no confidence motion with 177 yes voted, leading to speculation that at least 26 ANC politicians voted in favour of the opposition.Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) last week lambasted ANC MPs who voted in favour of the motion to remove Zuma. Having re-stated this undeniable fact we will, however, be amiss in our defence of the African National Congress and our National Democratic Revolution (NDR), not to express our deep disappointment in the 26 ANC MP s who voted in favour of the no-confidence motion, and disregarded the very clear instructions that they had from the National Executive Committee (NEC) as well as the Parliamentary Caucus of the ANC, said MKMVA.They added: With regards to their behaviour MKMVA believes that a spade should be called a spade: They have betrayed the trust that the ANC placed in them by deploying them as our representatives in Parliament in order to carry out the mandate of the ANC. Their behaviour was totally unacceptable.&#8221;Sabela reiterated that the ANC MPs &#8220;who were clear on voting for Zuma to go&#8221; must just face disciplinary action.&#8220;There were those who were clear when they spoke on TV about how they would vote. Dr Makhosi Khoza must be subjected to a disciplinary committee. Derek Hanekom was also very clear,&#8221; he said.TNA Reporter
