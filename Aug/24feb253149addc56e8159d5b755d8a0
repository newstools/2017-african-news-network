Johannesburg Executive Mayor has confirmed MMC for economic development Sharon Peetz has been axed.In the media statement, Mashaba said Peetz was fired on grounds of suspected misconduct.The dismissal comes after Peetz allegedly irregularly arranged for a family member to accompany her on an official trip to Spain.The allegation was levelled against her in a council meeting earlier this year.&#8220;I have taken the decision to remove the MMC for Economic Development, Cllr Sharon Peetz, from the Mayoral Committee, on grounds of suspected misconduct. The Federal Executive of the Democratic Alliance has agreed to this move,&#8221; said Mashaba in the media statement.&#8220;Cllr Peetz will be referred to the Party for consideration of further disciplinary processes in order to determine her culpability,&#8221; the statement read.Mashaba said through a forensic investigation conducted at the time, it was determined that the City had not incurred any costs for the travel of the family member. It was, therefore, determined that the allegations levelled against the Cllr Peetz at the time were without merit.&#8220;Recent evidence has been brought to our attention that the proof of payment, between Cllr Peetz and the Travel Agent, which the councillor had provided to my office as proof that she had paid the travel agent, was allegedly falsified. A further forensic investigation has been undertaken into the proof of payment. It is stressed that the money concerned remains allegedly owed to the Travel Agent, and it remains the case that the City has not incurred any losses,&#8221; he said.Meanwhile, speculation yesterday that Mashaba was on the verge of firing member of the mayoral council (MMC) for finance, Rabelani Dagada, amid an ongoing unresolved billing crisis.It is reported that at the beginning of this term of office, Mashaba presented Dagada as a competent and highly qualified individual who would take the city s finance department to new heights.Peetz is the second Johannesburg MMC to be fired by Mashaba within a space of 12 months.Jolidee Matongo spokesperson for ANC Greater Joburg claimed Mashaba had threatened to sack the MMC, said the mayor s outbursts on the billing crisis and his flimsy commitment to take over the resolution are to project Mashaba as a no-nonsense leader who is committed to fixing problems . The truth of the matter is that the mayor has messed up the system and now seeks a sacrificial lamb to take the blame for his ill-thought decisions, Matongo said.The ANC Johannesburg Region has learnt without any shock about the removal of Councillor Peetz as the MMC. The removal of Councillor Peetz is long overdue. At a Council meeting earlier this year the ANC presented the allegations of misconduct by Councillor Peetz pointing to the fact that she had used the City s money to take her mother on an official trip to Spain, Matongo said.Mashaba stated that MMC Dr Mpho Phalatse has agreed to act in the position of the axed MMC.TNA Reporter
