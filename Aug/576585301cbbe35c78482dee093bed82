The case against the two men who assaulted and forced Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatened to pour petrol on him resumes on Wednesday at the Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court in Mpumalanga.Taking the stand to testify on Wednesday is State&#8217;s second witness, Delton Sithole who has made claims that he was also assaulted by the two accused.Sithole had testified earlier that the assault occurred in the car, where he was lying on a bakkie while the accused kicked him.However he never reported the assault to the police, he told the court that he felt degraded by the incident. He only went to the police three months after the alleged assault had taken place.Sithole further told the court that ever since the two accused were released on bail he is living in fear that they might come after him.Meanwhile, in their court appearance on Monday, the duo, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson pleaded not guilty to all the charges levelled against them. Oosthuizen and Jackson face charges of attempted murder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, kidnapping, intimidation and possession of an illegal firearm.They were both granted R1000 bail in July this year.The coffin incident happened in 2016 in Mpumalanga where a video of two white males forcing the man into the coffin emerged and caused a public outrage. The video recording showed the two men beating Mlotswa and later forcing him into a coffin while he pleads with them.In solidarity of the accused, the DA announced that it would picket outside Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court.&#8220;Today, 2 August until Friday 4 August, DA members in Mpumalanga will picket against racism outside the Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court.&#8220;The DA believes that we must strive to build a society that is free of conflict and fear and that all South Africans must stand up against racial hatred and bigotry,&#8221; said the DA.-TNA Reporter
