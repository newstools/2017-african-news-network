Judge Segopotje Mphahlele is set to visit and make an inspection at the location where Victor Mlotshwa was forced into a coffin and threatened to be poured on with petrol by the two accused men in Mpumalanga.The two men are accused of having assaulted and forced Mlotswa into a coffin.In their court appearance on Monday, the duo, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson pleaded not guilty to all the charges levelled against them.Oosthuizen and Jackson face charges of attempted murder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, kidnapping, intimidation and possession of an illegal firearm.They were both granted R1000 bail in July this year.The coffin incident happened in 2016 in Mpumalanga where a video of two white males forcing the man into the coffin emerged and caused a public outrage. The video recording showed the two men beating Mlotswa and later forcing him into a coffin while he pleads with them.During their previous court appearances, the two have declared that they did not intend to do any harm to the man. They claim that the exercise was to teach the man a lesson .The case was initially heard by the Delmas Magistrate s Court and will be moving to the Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court as it continues.-TNA Reporter
