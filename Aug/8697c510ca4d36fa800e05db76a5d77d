The Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) says the called motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma is nothing more than a regime change attempt and political posturing by opposition parties aided by the media.As former National Finance Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas is leading a march to Parliament.Eastern Cape PEC reiterates its support for President Zuma and the entire leadership collective as elected in the previous ANC Conference in Mangaung &#8211; Bloemfontein.The march which is organised by 25 civil organisations and various religious groups, is a build-up to tomorrow s big day in parliament where members will vote on a motion of no confidence in Zuma.The PEC said it take note of the forces itching and advocating for regime change in the country, forces that are bent on agitating society for discontent and sowing the seed of unimaginable anarchy in South Africa.In a Meeting held at Calata house- King Williams town yesterday, ANC Spokesperson Mlibo Qoboshiyane said South Africa obtained its freedom and democracy through the conventional mechanism and sustained hosting of free and fair elections since the dawn of democracy as an expression of confidence in our country&#8217;s party political system.&#8220;The insatiable crave for the removal of President Zuma is a well calculated psychological warfare stratagem by the opposition as they have already made President Zuma their campaigning factor to achieve votes since he assumed office, therefore it is not in their interest that he must be out before 2019,&#8221; he said.It is said that Eastern Cape deployees to the National assembly were advised by the PEC to oppose this motion and strictly adhere to the party line and national caucus decision on the 8th August 2017 by defending the gains of our democracy.&#8220;It remains the PEC s view that an attack on president Zuma is a direct attack on the ANC and highest level to undermine the majority affirmation that gave ANC 62,5% of the electoral mandate in 2014 under President Zuma Presidency,&#8221; said Qoboshiyane.With some of the groups organised the march include Save SA, Sonke Gender Justice and Right to Know. Qhoboshiyane said the opposition parties have been working overtime subjecting their own members to lie detector tests.He said they even suspended and expelled some in an effort to identify party members who voted against their party position in relation to a motion of no confidence in Mogale City, Western Cape and yet when it comes to the ANC, they expect our own members to defy our party position and vote in favour of a no confidence motion on the ANC President. Such is high levels of hypocrisy seeks to undermine the intelligence of ANC members in general and parliamentarians in particular.&#8221;TNA Reporter &nbsp;
