The Grade 12 pupil is the latest bullying victim after he killed himself because he did not want to return to face his bullies at Reitumetse High School in Soshanguve.He complained to his mother that he was being bullied at school due to a mark which had developed on his face.The bullying intensified as the mark grew bigger and bigger.By June, the pupil had lost interest in school as the principal allegedly failed to intervene.His body was found hanging in his mother s bedroom by his 13-year-old sister on Wednesday.The mother, Patricia, said: I was called by the community that my son was not okay. Little did I know that my first born and the only boy in my home had decided to take his own life. The 43-year-old believes she was failed by the principal.She said the school had failed to take action against the bullies.This is despite the continuous appeals from Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi to school principals and teachers to take reports of bullying very seriously. We called the school principal and he said he would do something. But we did not hear from him and the bullying continued. In May, Amo developed a mark on his face. It kept on growing and growing. We tried all forms of creams and soaps but nothing helped. We ended up going to a doctor. From then he came back home sad from school and said he was being called names, Mamogale said.The mother went as far as calling the boy s friends and neighbours to motivate him but it did not help. Some of his friends confirmed what took place at school and my child was no longer happy. He cried every day. A poll undertaken in 2014 surveyed more than 2000 students. According to the results, an astounding 58% of South African students have been targeted by bullies.The Gauteng department of education said the matter was not reported to it but said that it would investigate.kutullom@thenewage.co.za
