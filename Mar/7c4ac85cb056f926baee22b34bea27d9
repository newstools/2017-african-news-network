A Mentally ill patient died at Kalafong Hospital on Friday, the Gauteng department of health announced yesterday.MEC Gwen Ramokgopa has conveyed her condolences to the family.According to the department, the patient was one of a group of patients who were transferred to Kalafong Hospital from one of 27 unlicensed NGOs.The department said it was still trying to locate his family or next of kin while the Mental Review Board has already been informed of his death.According to the department, the patient had been hospitalised since February 20, suffering from diabetesrelated complications.The death comes as the department is under pressure to transfer more than 700 patients still housed at illegal NGOs across the province within the 45-day period according to the recommendations of the health ombudsman, Prof Malegapuru Makgoba.The department is rushing against time with just a few days left before the 45-day deadline set by the ombudsman.More than 100 psychiatric patients have since died following the transfer of patients from Life Esidimeni to 27 unlicensed NGOs across the province by the department.This after the department terminated its long-running contract with the facility to cut cost.Last week Ramakgopa said the department did not want to repeat the deadly chaos that ensued following the transfers, saying the transfers would be done safely and with dignity to the patients.leratod@thenewage.co.za
