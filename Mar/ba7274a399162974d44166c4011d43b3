As a family restaurant, Spur does not condone this type of behaviour. We have investigated the incident with Texamo Spur staff and management, who expressed that they did in fact try to intervene, but were pushed away numerous times by the angry male customer&#8221;.Spur added &#8220;We do not condone any forms of violence against women or children, irrespective of the circumstances. We are very disappointed that children were exposed to this type of behaviour and would like to assure the public and all our loyal customers that we will not be taking this incident lightly.-TNA Reporter
