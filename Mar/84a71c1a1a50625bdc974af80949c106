The Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu has on Monday distanced herself from posters and flyers circulating on social media platforms on the African National Congress (ANC) leadership race.Sisulu said the circulating rumours suggesting that she is a candidate to be a Deputy President of the party, in a &#8220;slate&#8221; where Mathews Phosa is a President and many others, are false.I saw another mischievous poster with MathewsPhosa and Lindiwe Sisulu as Prez and DP respectively. Lesia (@lesiamolibeli) March 5, 2017&#8220;The Minister would like to put it on record again that she is not a candidate for any slate. She has not expressed any interest in the leadership of the ANC, either President or Deputy President. The Minister understands and respects the ANC processes. @JackD157 Cyril, Nkosazana, Gwede, Zweli, Baleka &amp; Lindiwe Sisulu (all ANC presidential candidates) allowing this nonsense on their watch. Moses Sakhile Njoko (@The_Njoko) March 5, 2017 &#8220;Members of the ANC and all South Africans are urged to ignore all posters and flyers related to this matter. The Minister s daily priority is to ensure that the human settlements sector delivers houses to the poorest of the poor as fast as possible,&#8221; the department said in a statement.In January, a slate for the ANC s December elective conference purportedly from the Cyril Ramaphosa camp emerged with Zweli Mkhize named as his deputy and Gauteng Premier David Makhura named as secretary-general.The slate proposesd 80 names for the party s national executive committee.This led the ANC to plead with its structures and leagues to hold back on the party s succession debate.It also follows President Jacob Zuma s view in the January 8 anniversary statement to do away with slates.The ANC Women s League and Youth League entered the fray by expressing their support for Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as Zuma s successor.ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa responded to the slate with a stern warning to the ANC s structures, including the ANC Women s League , to refrain from making public statements on the leadership issue.TNA Reporter
