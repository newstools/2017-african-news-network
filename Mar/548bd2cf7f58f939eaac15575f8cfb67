&nbsp;One suspect, among the four arrested in connection with the OR Tambo International Airport multimillion-rand heist will appear at the Kempton Park Magistrate court on Wednesday.Two of the four people arrested in connection with the heist, one of them a police officer, appeared in court on Tuesday. Two were taken in for questioning, it is unclear at this stage when the fourth suspect will appear.Acting national police commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane said two of the suspects appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate s Court yesterday and the other two were still being questioned. It is highly regrettable that one of our own is among the suspects. This confirms our version of not ruling out the possibility of collusion or an inside job. Our investigations continue and further court appearances and arrests are likely to be made, he said.Meanwhile, four people were arrested in connection with the six bodies found from March 5-6 in the vicinity of the railway line in Benoni, Phahlane said.KUTULLO MADISHA
