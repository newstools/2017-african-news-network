Social entrepreneur Nkosinathi Manganyi has embarked on a 40 day walk from Giyani to Cape Town (1 876 kilometres) in order to raise awareness and money for poor schools. He aims to raise money in order to rebuild the libraries as well as revamp the bathrooms in Giyani schools.Manganyi started the walk on the 26 February and so far has walked 473 km as he passes Johannesburg on Wednesday. This might just be his biggest journey yet but it&#8217;s certainly not the first, he started back in 2014 when he walked from Johannesburg to Bloemfontein, in 2015 he walked from Port Elizabeth to Bloemfontein.Speaking to The New Age Maganyi says he was inspired by his friend and always wanted to give back to the community. &#8221;I had a friend who was diagnosed with bone cancer and they had to amputate his leg. It was at that moment that I realized how fortunate I was and wanted to give back to the community and show gratitude to God,&#8221; Maganyi said.He adds that a few months after this realisation he attended a seminar where he met a guy who walked for 29 days at the North Pole. &#8220;Right there and then I decided that next year on my birthday I&#8217;m walking to Bloemfontein. I didnt know how but I knew I had to do it,&#8221; he said.Maganyi has urged all South Africans to join his call for changing lives and play their part. &#8220;It s not about the money, It&#8217;s about playing your part with the little that you have.&#8221;Kgothatso Phatladira
