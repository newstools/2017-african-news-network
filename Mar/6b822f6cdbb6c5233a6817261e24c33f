The man named during a press conference as wanted in connection with the burglary in the office of the Chief Justice was on Friday arrested. The man Nkosinathi Msimango handed himself over yesterday at the Boschkop police station saying he wished to clear his name. Police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane said during a press conference announcing the arrest of two others that the police wanted to speak to Msimango in connection with the robbery last weekend. Msimango s lawyer Sammy Mahlangu was reported to have said that his client had no idea about the robbery and was not on or near the scene at the time. Fifteen computers were stolen from the Office of the Chief Justice in a burglary. There has been speculation of sinister motives for the burglary in the computers in the HR department because of the sensitive information contained on the computers. &#8211; ANN7 reporter
