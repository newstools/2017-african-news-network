Members of the Olievenhoutbosch community blockaded roads on Monday in protest over poor service delivery and crime in the area. The community says they feel neglected by the municipality. Hundreds of protesters closed the R 55 road near centurion towards extension 4. The community began marching from the water berg open grounds. Solly Thabatha, a community leader, said they are fed up with the situation. &#8220;Our service delivery is very poor here if you can check extension 60 there is only two bridges that are going to the community, our cars are not able to cross to the other side even our kids on rainy days, cannot even go to school,&#8221; said Thabatha. &#8220;We cannot be staying under such conditions, like pigs, the municipality and national province must come down to us and reply to our grievances,&#8221; said Thabatha. The community says it is also concerned by the level of crime and corruption within the municipality. They said they are also worried about RDP houses which are allegedly being sold to people who do not reside at Olievenhoutbosch . They accused a local Councillor of selling the RDP houses. &#8220;If you are not a Sanco member they cannot give you any work, our kids after grade 12 they cannot find work and they taking drugs and the Councillor cant even help them,&#8221; a resident said. She also mentioned the current RDP houses that are being constructed but says locals struggle to get any jobs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAwUD0LvLE&#038;t=151sTNA Reporter &nbsp;
