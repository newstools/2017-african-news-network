&nbsp;The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Nelson Mandela Foundation called on the parliamentary leadership of the ANC to insist that Parliament is recalled to debate a motion of no-confidence. The organisations said during a press briefing held on Friday to express their dismay that the official memorial service on Ahmed Kathrada had been postponed indefinitely. This follows an early morning Cabinet reshuffle in which Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were axed. We call on the parliamentary leadership of the ANC, supported by all opposition parties, to insist that Parliament is recalled immediately to debate a motion of no-confidence, proposed by the ANC leadership in parliament. We call on all members of parliament to unite and support a motion of no-confidence, the foundations said in a statement. We call on the people of SA in their mass formations to take to the streets and to make their views known. We support the rallying calls resounding across South Africa for all South African citizens to make their voices heard and take action to safeguard the future of all our children. While the move has been widely criticised, the ANC has called for unity and the ANCYL and the ANCWL have both welcomed the cabinet reshuffle.&nbsp;&#8211; Staff Reporter
