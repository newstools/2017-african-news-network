Residents in the province can do better in building united communities if they emulate the exemplary role played by the late liberation stalwart John Beaver Marks.These were the words uttered by Premier Supra Mahumapelo when he unveiled a six-metre bronze statue erected in honour of Marks in Ventersdorp on Saturday.With the former Ventersdorp local municipality merged with Tlokwe to form municipality 405, there is a growing call that the new municipality be named JB Marks local municipality.Mahumapelo said people in the province should strive for unity, saying a united, democratic, non-sexist, non-racial and a prosperous society is what the late Marks pursued and fought for.The premier said while unity is a good thing at all times, it is the best gift the current generation can bequeath to future leaders. We must in honour of the selfless liberation fighters like JB Marks, always make sure that we put the unity of South Africans first in whatever we do. The history that JB Marks and other forefathers have left, is something that we must talk about and always remember, Mahumapelo said. He said keeping memories of icons like Marks alive was critical for the future generation.Mahumapelo, who was joined by the Deputy Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Andries Nel, the speaker of the provincial legislature Susanna Dantjie and members of the executive council, had earlier in the day visited the two Marks families in Tshing township, Ventersdorp, where he also spoke of the significance of unity within the family.Speaking on behalf of the family, Roswyn Marks, one of JB Marks great-grandchildren, expressed the family s gratitude for efforts by the government to honour their grandfather.She said the repatriation and reburial of his remains as well as the erection of the statue, all demonstrated the indispensable leadership role their great-grandfather played in the fight against colonialism and apartheid. We thank the government of South Africa and North West province for this honour, which with no doubt, befits our great grandfather s legacy, Roswyn said.JB Marks, whose remains were reburied on March 22, 2015, in his home town of Ventersdorp after being repatriated from Moscow in Russia, is a renowned hero who contributed immensely to the liberation struggle.He was born on March 21, 1903 and died on August 1, 1972, in Moscow after suffering a heart attack.The provincial department of culture, arts and traditional affairs, which is the custodian of the province s cultural, artistic and heritage programme, led the process of erecting the statue.This was done in collaboration with the reconciliation, healing and renewal unit in the office of the premier.The site on which Marks remains were reburied and statue erected has been declared a heritage site.Present at the unveiling of the statue was the Marks family, community members from in and around Ventersdorp and various political leaders.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
