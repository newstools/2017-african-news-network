Sanral has dismissed reports that users of toll roads were not properly notified about toll tariffs adjustments.Toll tariffs on national roads were adjusted in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on March3. SANRAL said the public was invited to comment after the Minister of Transport approved the tariffs and the adjustments which were gazetted and published on February 16. It is one thing to say there was no communication but quite another to call for the use of more communication platforms, something we will explore in the future, says Vusi Mona the agency s spokesperson.The tariffs include monthly caps for registered users of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP). There is a R250 per month cap for vehicles of Sanral account holders. This has not changed and remains applicable irrespective of the number of gantry passes or the distance travelled on Gauteng e-toll roads, added Mona.Sanral announced an annual 6.04% increase in toll tariffs across the 3 120km national toll road network, effective from March 3.Regular users can pay less than the R250 monthly cap if they travel outside peak traffic hours of 6am to 8.30am and 4pm to 7pm on weekdays. Out of peak hours discounts of up to 57.9% apply.Unregistered road users will, however, have to pay the increased tariffs on the GFIP roads. Sanral has, once again, demonstrated its commitment to reduce the burden on road users in Gauteng especially among low &#8211; and middle-income families, says Mona. Taxis and public transport buses also remain entirely exempt from toll fees.Mona said income is used to continue maintaining the national toll road network in top condition-Ntsako Mashaba
