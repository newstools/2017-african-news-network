A woman has warned commuters to be careful about travelling alone after she was allegedly raped by a group of men travelling in a white Toyota Quantum taxi.This emerged in a radio interview where the woman told Kaya FM on Wednesday that she was allegedly raped by three men.&#8220;I boarded a taxi, inside there were three men and a lady. At the next stop the other lady got off,&#8221; she said, once alone the men targeted her.The men raped her, demanded her bank cards and pin codes. The men were carrying a speed point with them, she alleged.She was then dumped at a veld in Dube, Soweto where she got help from a man who told her she was the third victim he had helped.When the woman arrived at Braamfischerville Police Station, she was asked if she perhaps didn&#8217;t know her perpetrators &#8211; suggesting that she was falsely reporting the rape.They then referred her to Orlando Police Station where she reported the rape and was assisted.A female police officer from the station s rape unit took her to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital where was assisted many hours later, at about 1am, for a rape that had happened at 8am.While she was in the queue the entire evening and into the early hours of the morning, eight more women came in saying they had been raped in a similar fashion.TNA Reporter
