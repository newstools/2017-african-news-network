Denel has moved to court to obtain approval for a joint venture with VR Laser Asia. The state-owned arms manufacturer said on Friday it had attempted on many occasions to work with Treasury and Minister Pravin Gordhan to explain legal processes followed to establish the joint venture with VR Laser Asia. Its application was lodged in the North Gauteng High Court on Friday. The acting Chief Executive Zwelakhe Ntshepe said the joint venture had been established in terms of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). &#8220;We acted lawfully and in accordance, and compliance, with the provisions of sections 51(1)(g), 54(2)(b) and 54(3) of the PFMA in concluding and forming the joint venture agreement,&#8221; Ntshepe said. Salim Essa, the sole proprietor of VR Laser Asia has been associated with the Gupta family in reports and the Public Protector s State of Capture report but he has denied that there is a link between the South African company VR Laser and the company in Asia. Ntshepe is reported to have said that the negative perceptions around Denel had affected its ability to do business in the region. HE said that by 2018 two-thirds of global defense procurement outside the US would be with the Asia-Pacific nations. Because of this unresolved legal standing the company had missed out on lucrative opportunities. &#8211; ANN7 reporter &nbsp;
