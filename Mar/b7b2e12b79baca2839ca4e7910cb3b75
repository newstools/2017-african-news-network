After a decade of peeling off for X-rated movies, a Japanese porn actress famous for being the country&#8217;s oldest has called it quits at the ripe old age of 80.Maori Tezuka, a former opera singer who made her debut in Japan&#8217;s flourishing &#8220;silver porn&#8221; industry at a sprightly 71, blamed her decision partly on a lack of red-blooded Lotharios able to keep up with her.&#8220;Once the lights go on, you just do your best,&#8221; she told local media.&#8220;I have no regrets, but shooting became difficult when the actor wasn&#8217;t my type,&#8221; added Tezuka, who in true showbiz fashion left the door open for a possible return.&#8220;It was never about the money for me. I&#8217;ve already been asked about returning in two or three years I said I&#8217;d think about it.&#8221;Geronto-porn is not for the faint-hearted but is big business in Japan where around 34 million people or a quarter of the population are over 65.Japan&#8217;s porn industry rakes in about $20 billion a year, with movies featuring rambunctious geriatrics accounting for around a quarter of that market, industry insiders say.In recent years sales have soared as more of the country&#8217;s perky seniors celebrate their mojo.The genre took off thanks largely to the exploits of Shigeo Tokuda, an 82-year-old actor who has appeared in hundreds of blue movies with titles such as &#8220;Forbidden Elderly Care&#8221; and &#8220;Manic Training of Lolitas&#8221;.-AFP
