Net 1 CEO Serge Belamant has said it is ready to continue with the provision of social grants on April 1, but will need a new contract by March 15.Cash Paymaster Services is a subsidiary of Net 1 and its contract with South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) to deliver 17-million social grants has come to an end. In 2014 the Constitutional Court found the contract to be unlawful but allowed it to continue until a new tender was awarded in order to prevent disruption in the grant payments.Belamant confirmed to ANN7 that they have entered into an agreement with SASSA but the terms will be revealed by the department.Belamant also stated that the financial deal was being discussed within government circles between Social Development and the Treasury.This would be a two-year contract, he said but did not disclose the details.All he said that currently the company charged R16.44 for each grant and said it had not increased this amount for four years &#8211; despite inflation. The (new)costs, he said, Were certainly less than was being reported in the media. Yesterday Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini confirmed that the contract had not yet been signed.Dlamini confirmed yesterday that initially Treasury had decided not to come to the negotiations.Belamant said he was proud of his company s achievements despite the reputational damage it has suffered due to the court case and the current debacle. We have done a fantastic job so far, he said and he doubted any other institution would have been able provide this service as efficiently.Meanwhile, President Jacob Zuma called in the two ministers who had differing views on how to resolve the issue and insisted that they settle their differences as the matter was resolvable.-Cecilia Russell
