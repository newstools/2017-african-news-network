Coal truck drivers on Wednesday embarked on an illegal protest by blocking all major routes into Pretoria as they prepared for their march to the Union buildings.According to Eskom&#8217;s spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe, the protest comes as an unintended consequence of government&#8217;s decision to bring in more Independent Power Producers into the national energy grid.&#8220;The coal suppliers feel like they are likely to lose their livelihoods because of the advent of the renewable energy Programme &#8221; said Phasiwe.This comes after President Jacob Zuma announced during his state of the nation address that government is committed to expanding the Independent Power Producers Programme and Eskom will sign the outstanding power purchase agreements for renewable energy.Phasiwe added that Eskom is working within a broader framework of government&#8217;s program to reduce green house gas emissions and dependence on coal.&#8221;We want to have more renewable energy projects and this means that at some point we going have some mines and power stations close down. &#8221;#InTheNews: @Eskom_SA Khulu Phasiwe: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been directed by govt to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.&#8221; More: https://t.co/eiQ8bIFIbO Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) March 1, 2017According to reports, the truck drivers are planning to march from Marabastad to deliver a memorandum to the President at the Union Buildings, Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson says they only approved a march from Marabastad to PTA CBD and not blockage of any roads. &#8220;We were not informed of any blockages of entrance into Tshwane, it was illegal and we will take legal action against the organisers.Mahamba added they have deployed officers in all affected areas and residents are advised to use alternative routes to avoid delaysHowever, City of Tshwane took to Twitter stating that the protests by drivers was not approved by Tshwane Metro Police.We would like to put it on the record that the March by coal tipper truck drivers was not approved by @TMPDSafety :@SollyMsimanga City of Tshwane (@CityTshwane) March 1, 2017Please try using alternative routes.
