With the lack of job opportunities and the uncertainty of financial stability being a constant worry for many South Africans, small business owners are starting to realise the importance of retaining their clientele and ensuring satisfactory profits.It has been estimated that the total economic output of small business in the country is 50% of the GDP with a further estimation that they provide employment for about 60% of the labour force.It is therefore not surprising that outlets, also referred to as spaza shops, are seen as relatively big contributors to the economy and to many, a lucrative business option in various townships.Albeit a great opportunity for budding entrepreneurs, these small business owners are left with several challenges which include budgeting, creating a successful outlet and also marketing their business. How then does one ensure that their business thrives despite turbulent economic conditions?That s where Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) comes in.To help with some of these problems, the company introduced an initiative that they have called Grow my Business. This initiative, which forms part of our business mandate to uplift and develop our communities, imparts the necessary knowledge and fundamentals to local small business owners with regards to running a successful outlet. It consists of a one-day free training session whereby business owners get a better understanding of what a successful outlet and outlet owner looks like, in turn making the necessary changes to ensure profitability for their business, Nadine Warwick, CCBSA district manager for Pretoria says.The first Grow my Business training in the north region took place in Soshanguve recently where 57 small business owners gathered to be trained on pertinent components such as planning, budgeting, promotions and finance,s just to name a few, in their own language. Numerous studies that have been conducted since 2008 show that owners attending a similar training programme were likely to increase their sales.Many other training sessions are expected to take place in other areas such as Ga-Rankuwa, Hammanskraal and the Pretoria CBD.Bernard Mathole, who has been a small business owner for the past 15 years said at the training: I am very glad that I was invited to this training in Soshanguve. This training gives me an advantage over my competitors and allows me to be more versatile in how I conduct business. I am able to fight against the poverty that is affecting many of my fellow brothers and sisters and expand on my abilities as a businessman. This is just one of many ways that we have provided suitable opportunities to communities in which we have a presence. We value enterprise development and community development very highly in the business and we will continue seeking viable ways to ensure that we, as a corporate citizen, do our best to assist and nurture skills where possible, Warwick said.Sello Rabothatasellor@thenewage.co.za
