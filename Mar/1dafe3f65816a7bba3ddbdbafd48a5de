The knowledge that Uncle Kathy, as Ahmed Kathrada was known, was in his twilight years did little to lessen the blow of this passing, the ANC said.The 87-year-old Kathrada passed away on Tuesday morning, at the Donald Gordon Hospital in Johannesburg after a short period of illness, following surgery to the brain.The party which Kathrada served faithfully paid tribute to Kathrada saying: &#8220;His life is a lesson in humility, tolerance, resilience and a steadfast commitment to principle, even when taking a principled stance would place him at odds with his comrades. &#8221;&#8220;Uncle Kathy, despite disagreement with the ANC leadership from time-to-time, never abandoned nor turned his back on the ANC and always affirmed that the ANC and the ANC alone was the only political organization that reflected the values and aspirations of all South Africans,&#8221; said ANC Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe in a statement.Referring to disagreements with ANC leadership, last year Kathrada called on ANC president Jacob Zuma to step down.In a letter dated March 31 Kathrada said: In the face of such persistently widespread criticism, condemnation and demand, is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum, to consider stepping down?&#8221;Despite the disagreements the ANC continued to look to Uncle Kathy as a guiding voice of reason.&#8220;Until his hospitalization Uncle Kathy was an active and vocal participant in the work of the elder statesmen of the ANC towards keeping our great revolutionary movement on course.&#8221;&#8220;His was a constant, steady and moral voice, and we are all the poorer to have lost him,&#8221; said Mantashe.The ANC honoured Kathrada bestowing the title of Isithwalandwe/Seaparankoe upon him.&#8220;The title of Isithwalandwe/Seaparankoe is the highest honour that can be bestowed by the African National Congress (ANC) and the people of South Africa on those who have made an outstanding contribution and sacrifice to the liberation struggle,&#8221; said Mantashe.A slew of tributes have steadily poured in for Kathrada since the announcement of his passing.Kathrada is survived by his wife, Barbara Hogan.TNA Reporter
