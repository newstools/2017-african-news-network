Parliament should establish an ad- hoc committee to probe allegations that members of the Gupta family have captured Cabinet Ministers and the President.This is according to Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane.Maimane during a press conference today said that the DA will call for the committee to be established by the National Assembly.&#8220;The powers of this committee will allow it to summon any person to give evidence and first of these must be the Guptas,&#8221; said Maimane.The DA leader also announced that he will lay criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma.@BDliveSA @LindaEnsor Charges r prepared against the accused.These are some of the front men who are defrauding the people of SA whilst protected by anc.#change19 pic.twitter.com/hd4cwAnhCM Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) May 29, 2017This comes after publications on Sunday ran reports based on explosive emails and letters that claim the Gupta family were consulted in the appointment of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.The reports claimed Zwane s CV was sent to the family a month before his appointment.&#8220;We cannot allow the undermining and breach of laws that define our sovereignty, for the benefit of the Guptas profits,&#8221;&#8221; The criminal charges we lay will be directed both at corruptors &amp; corruptees, who both have serious cases to answer ,&#8221; said Maimane. The Gupta family has however dismissed the reports as nothing but fake news .The family s lawyer, Gert van der Merwe, said the weekend reports relied on undisclosed documents and assumptions of impropriety, resulting in a clear intention to influence political perception.DA Federal Chairperson James Selfe said they wanted to know who put pressure on Zuma to remove Ministers standing in the way of the Gupta family during his recent Cabinet Reshuffle.&#8220;We&#8217;re also investigating if the crime of treason has been committed,&#8221; said Selfe.Meanwhile , commenting on the outcomes of the ANC national executive committee meeting over the weekend Maimane said the party was incapable of self correction.This comes after reports suggest that Zuma appears to have staved off another motion of no confidence in him.&#8220;Jacob Zuma is the ANC, and the ANC is Jacob Zuma. The ANC NEC decision, to keep Zuma in power is a most serious crime against the people of South Africa,&#8221; said Maimane.-TNA Reporter
