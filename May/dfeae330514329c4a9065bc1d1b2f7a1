At the time of closing the application process on 4 May 2017, we received a staggering 65 000 applications. Receiving this overwhelming response from the public indicates that the residents of Joburg are keen to join the JMPD and those members of the public want to be a part of the team of men and women who go beyond the call of duty to make our communities safe, Longwe added.The city said at the time of closing date the application stood at staggering 65 000 applications. The city further said all successful candidates will be expected to undergo a series of tests such as, fitness test, where the applicants will have to demonstrate physical and mental fitness for the job before undergoing training.Longwe also said he believed the newly recruits will contribute greatly to the City s efforts to combat crime, enforce bylaws and manage traffic congestion.-TNA Reporter
