This bakkie then sped off at high speed. We followed it because of the suspicious behaviour of the driver and occupants. When they noticed that they were being followed, they stopped at the Qediphika School before again speeding along the Blood River Road. The driver then suddenly made a U-turn and sped off again, said IFP National Chairperson, Mr Blessed Gwala. We are aware that there should be no campaigning today and therefore we are concerned when such things are taking place while voting is in progress. We know that the ANC is using all sorts of dirty tricks to win this municipality so that the can take control of the Umzinyathi District and get their hands on lucrative municipal contracts.&#8220;Yesterday we exposed the fact that the ANC had hired ten busses from Durban to transport their supporters to Nquthu. We have copies of the invoices to prove this. If there was nothing underhanded in the hiring the ten busses from Durban, we question why the ANC cancelled the busses at the eleventh hour after we went to the media and exposed them.&#8220;We are vigilant on the ground and we are confident that the people of Nquthu will not be fooled by such dirty tricks, concluded Mr Gwala
