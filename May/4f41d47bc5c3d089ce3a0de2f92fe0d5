The nationl Treasury stands accused of hiding an internal audit report which shows gross negligence of business practises in the office responsible for the setting up and management of Government s critical Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).The internal audit details a total of 54 IFMS processes that were singled out by the audit all of which were problematic but more damning is that 49 of those were found to be catastrophic . The government budgeted R4.3bn over five years for the setting up of the IFMS processes.The report was handed to former Treasury ditrector-general Lungisa Fuzile on September 11, 2015. At the time Nhlanhla Nene was the minister and Mcebisi Jonas was his deputy.Since then, sources say, this report has languished despite damning evidence of mismanagement and potential fraud highlighted. Catastrophic is a technical term used by auditors to suggest there was inadequate management of the financial management processes and as a result, this could bring the national Treasury brand and reputation into disrepute.The report said that in the 49 catastrophic processes there were non-existent financial and operating controls and it hints at illegality and that processes were not compliant with the law and regulations.IFMS was a project cleared in 2005 for the integration across the national and provincial government of supply chain, human resources, financial, payroll and business intelligence management. It was a joint project of the Treasury, State Information Technology Agency (Sita) and Department of Public Service and Administration.Seven years after it was approved it was found the IFMS project deliverables were inadequate and a revised plan was accepted by the Cabinet in 2013.In 2015, a mere 17 months later, this revised project was found to be highly problematic.At the heart of the many problems uncovered was the fact that the FMS project management office (PMO) had not been set up with a business plan, it failed to give a budget breakdown for financial years and the project costs were not monitored.In addition, there was no quality assurance function in place, the payment register was incomplete, there was ineffective resource management and, the internal audit report said, it had found there was expenditure not related to the IFMS project.As a result within 17 months, R139m of the five-year budget of the R145m budget was spent leaving only R6m for the remaining 43 months.The shambolic management of the PMO service level agreements with identified service providers was also problematic if not illegal.One such service provider, Bitz Technologies, was given a service level agreement of R39m R11m more than the R28m the company had quoted.This faulty contract was then cancelled on September 30, 2014 and a new, contract was signed for R28m, but this did not take into account that Bitz had already been paid R5m.In addition, in the period October 2014 to December 2014, when there was no service level agreement in place between the Treasury and Bitz, R1.5m was paid for services.In the most dry auditing terms the report points that at best this was ineffective cost management but their disbelief at how the project is being managed emerges. We cannot believe that such clear cases of irregular expenditure where payments are made to service providers in the absence of a formal contract are condoned. There is absolutely no justification for allowing such incidents from occurring whether the chief financial officer has granted permission or not, the report reads.In addition, the same company was accused of double billing for hours worked.ANN7 was unable to establish whether any of the actions recommended by the internal audit has been carried out this includes the investigation of the services provided in the absence of oversight and action taken against officials who authorised the payment without a formal agreement.While the Treasury is yet to respond to our queries an employee working in the Treasury said that what was exposed in the audit report was only the tip of the iceberg. ANN7 and TNA will bring you a day-by-day account of the many other issues found by the internal audit report.Cecilia RussellCecilia Russell is ANN7 editor for special projects
