Net1 has announced that Mr. Serge Belamant will retire as CEO of the company at the end of the month.The company announced on Thursday that its current CEO Herman G. Kotz will take over from Belmant on 1 June 2017.According to Net1 while Belmant was scheduled to retire next year his early retirement has been brought on &#8221; to facilitate changes to the Company s operating and management structures&#8221;.&#8220;Mr Belamant has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company for a two-year period after his retirement. This will allow the Company to retain the benefit of Mr. Belamant s technical expertise and many years of experience in the industry, particularly for assistance in the development of Net1 s international operations,&#8221; said Net 1 in a press statement.Belamant was at the centre of the SASSA social grant payment debacle as Cash Paymaster Services which overseas the payment of grants is owned by Net1.Back in 2014 the Constitutional Court declared the contract between Sassa and CPS invalid and called on the Department of Social Development to dissolve the contract and build up capacity to take over payment of social grants.His handling of the matter has led to him at times being labelled arrogant, including by former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.In March the ConCourt ruled that the contract with Cash Paymaster Services, could be extended for another 12 months.It, however, made a ruling that the Sassa database could not be used for marketing purposes. The company was criticised for doing this ahead of the Con Court ruling.&#8220;He leaves the Company well-positioned to grow its international footprint while at the same time having the capacity to expand its South African operations and introduce new business models responsive to the needs of South Africans,&#8221; the statement said.&#8220;The Board thanks Mr. Belamant for his leadership and enduring contribution to the Company and wish him well in more relaxed years ahead, said Net 1 chairman Christopher Seabrooke.-TNA Reporter
