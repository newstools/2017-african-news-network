The animosity between IPID head Robert Mcbride and acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane was on full display before Parliament on Tuesday.The Police portfolio committee called the two to explain the ongoing feud between the organisations.IPID head Robert McBride came out swinging accusing the police of interference following investigations into Phahlane.According to IPID&#8217;s presentation when it investigates senior SAPS officers, they are then counter investigated on the most &#8216;outrageous&#8217; allegations.Head of investigations at IPID, Mathew Sesoko added that when Gen Phahlane became aware of a probe into him he contacted several witnesses instructing them not to cooperate.IPID also recommended that Phahlane be suspended or put on leave to prevent further interference in his probe.Phahlane has been accused of corruption which resulted in a raid at his Sable Hills Waterfront Estate home in Pretoria.IPID had obtained a search and seizure warrant to look into Phahlane s possession of a home theatre system to the value of R80 000.However, Phahlane on Tuesday fired back accusing IPID of being in cahoots with private investigator Paul O&#8217;Sullivan and pushing a smear campaign against him in order to discredit him.&#8220;IPID should be called OPID because they are captured by Mr O&#8217;Sullivan. I&#8217;d also like to congratulate Mr McBride &amp; Mr O&#8217;Sullivan on a well oiled propaganda machine,&#8221; said Phahlane.He continued to deny any wrongdoing particularly around allegations of interfering in on-going IPID investigations.&#8220;We do not have the appetite to interfere in any investigation. I have given my all as far as cooperation with any investigation,&#8221; said Phahlane.Phahlane:to date the meeting referred to in letter from #IPID relating to their investigations into Phahlane, has not taken place @ANN7tv Keorapetse Mahlobo (@KeoraMahlobo) May 16, 2017Phahlane: The first time I knew abt these allegations was when a Mr Nkabinde called me and said he wanted to see me #IPID @ANN7tv Keorapetse Mahlobo (@KeoraMahlobo) May 16, 2017Responding to allegations that he was corrupt Phahlane said that he had been employed for 32 years and that between himself and his wife generated a joint income of R2.5-million annually.&#8220;Therefore I don&#8217;t need no favours from service providers. I have relationships with them but they&#8217;re not corrupt relationships,&#8221; said Phahlane.-TNA Reporter
