The National Consumer Tribunal (NCT) has handed down a judgment against Edcon for charging its club fee to credit customers.The NCT said that Club fee charged by Edcon was unlawful and in contravention of the National Credit Act (NCA).This judgment comes after an investigation by the National Credit Regulator (NCR) revealed Edcon has charged consumers a club fee on credit agreements. It is now settled that the charging of a club fee on credit agreements is not permitted by the NCA, NCR Investigations and Enforcement manager Jacqueline Peters said.&#8220;The Tribunal in its judgment said that the intention of the NCA is very clear when it relates to credit agreement. The NCA does not allow for any other fees or charges or costs to be included in the credit agreement or credit agreement documents, irrespective of the nature of the charge, fee or cost.Peters added that the judgment provides clarity to the retailers that they should observe the closed list of fees and charges provided for in the NCA.&#8220;Consumers are urged to request the quotation from their credit providers so that they can properly check the cost of credit that is being offered.&#8221;The NCR will approach Edcon to request an independent audit of their loan book in order to establish the number of consumers to be refunded and the total amount to be refunded from 2007 to date.A hearing date will be set by the Tribunal to hear argument on the quantum of the administrative fine.TNA Reporter
