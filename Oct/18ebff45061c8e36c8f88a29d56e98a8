SOUTH African born comedian Trevor Noah has won yet another book prize for his memoir, Born A Crime. The host of The Daily Show whose star continues to soar was awarded the Thurber Prize for American Humour this week. The only recognition for the art of humour writing in the US, the win comes just two months after the comedian was shortlisted alongside playwright-screenwriter Ken Pisani’s novel, Amp’d, and Aaron Thier’s time travelling novel, Mr Eternity. The New York-based local star was announced as the winner at a ceremony at Carolines on Broadway in New York City on Monday. It seems Noah’s recollections of his life in the dusty streets of Soweto well ahead of his competitors as the judges unanimously chose him as the ultimate winner, with a pay cheque of $5 000 (R68 000) and a crystal plaque. Previous winners of the prize include Noah’s predecessor at the Daily Show, Jon Stewart, Calvin Trillin and David Sedaris. The South African comedian has also won two NAACP Awards for his memoir which is still a best seller locally and internationally.  SIYABONGA SITHOLE  siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
