Not even courts are allowed to go there.” ” The Public Protector must tell us where she gets the power to say her findings must be investigated by someone else,” said Semenya. However, Mlambo questioned the argument saying If the PP has found wrongdoing, it obligates her to recommend remedial action. ” I use the word obligate deliberately,” said Mlambo. However, according to Semenya, the Public Protector cannot make find findings based on allegations and suspicions. ” She must investigate and having investigated that she must then make findings. She has found that there is conduct which is improper and results in impropriety,” he said.
