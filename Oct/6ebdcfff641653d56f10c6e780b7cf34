NMU students were shocked because two of students were attacked in a computer lab, raped. One was also stabbed in the back. “The suspect was arrested at Port Elizabeth central and he will be appearing in court on Friday,” said Naidu. Classes are expected to resume after two days of stayaways in protest of the crimes. Activities came to a halt on Tuesday as students protested demanding their security concerns on campus were addressed. The university announced that it will beefing up their security system. “We are heightening security by increasing the number of staff to undertake visible patrolling across all campuses, including all teaching venues, from now until the end of exams,” said NMU spokesperson Zandile Mbalela. She said after the meeting with management and student leaders it was agreed that classes should resume today. “The agreement effectively brings to an end two days of demonstrations by students, who have raised a number of safety and security concerns. This follows the vicious rape and stabbing of two female students on Monday night at the Second Avenue Campus,” said Mbalela. In a separate incident, gunshots were fired Wednesday morning when an orange Ford Ranger tried to force its way through security. The Herald reported security refused to let the driver through and the person then fired four shots in the air trying to force entry. Police then chased the vehicle and four suspects were arrested.
