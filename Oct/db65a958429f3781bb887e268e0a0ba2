The Russian Embassy has on Monday responded to media reports alleging that President Vladimir Putin had a hand in the recent Cabinet reshuffle ​saying the reports were false. The Sunday Times reported the ​C​abinet reshuffle came about following a meeting ​with Russian government. It report​ed that ​President Jacob Zuma was allegedly warned to implement the R1-trillion  with the Russian government. “We are highly disappointed to see yet another example of sensationalism and ​fake ​news in South African press, especially, in an evident attempt to emulate the worst kind of groundless anti-Russian attacks by some of the global mainstream media. ​​We consider this slanderous piece, which is (as usual) based entirely on hearsay and unnamed ​’sources​’ ​for ​information, unfit for a serious publication such as Sunday Times claims to be​,” said the Embassy in a statement. The Embassy further dismissed the claims made in reports that a high delegation from Russia met with president Zuma before the ​C​abinet reshuffle to hold talks about the nuclear project. ​”The Embassy is completely unaware of any high-level Russian delegation coming to South Africa last week. Apparently, either these anonymous ​’​sources​’ (if they do exist) know more than we do, or they live in some alternate reality,” reads the statement. Meanwhile the Embassy further said that the media house did not contact them to verify the facts of their allegations in the report.  -TNA Reporter
