A court case between Minister of Home Affairs Hlengiwe Mkhize and Former DG Mkuseli Apleni to have his suspension overturned has been moved to Thursday. Early last month the department announced Apleni’s suspension but did not provide reasons for his suspension. “The Home Affairs Minister, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize, announced that the department’s Director-General, Mr. Mkuseli Apleni, has been placed on precautionary suspension as of today, 18 September 2017,” Mkhize’s spokesperson Mpume Madlala said. Meanwhile, Apleni’s lawyer Sandile July had since maintained that his client’s suspension was unlawful. “For now, we believe that the suspension is unlawful. That’s all we will say for now,” July said. The former Director General was entangled in the saga around the decision to grant members of the Gupta family citizenship. The minister yesterday sent written replies to members of Parliament on the circumstances around the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family. Mkhize said “exceptional circumstances” had compelled the department to grant the Gupta family South African citizenship. “The consideration to grant citizenship to the family was based on the business investments and social partnerships as highlighted in the Oakbay Company letter,” Mkhize said. Malusi Gigaba, in his former capacity as Home Affairs minister, granted members of the Gupta family citizenship by setting aside a provision that required applicants to be in the country for at least five years before applying. -TNA Reporter
