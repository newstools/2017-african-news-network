Hurricane Nate was bearing down on popular Mexican beach resorts and headed for the US Gulf coast early Saturday after killing at least 28 people in Central America. At 0330 GMT, the US National Hurricane Center said the storm had top winds of 121 kilometers (75 miles) per hour, making it just strong enough to reach Category One strength. It was located about 95 miles west-northwest of the western tip of Cuba. AFPÂ
