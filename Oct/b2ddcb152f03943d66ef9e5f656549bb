Tributes continue to pour in for Health Department spokesperson Joe Maila. Maila died after a shooting accident at a rifle range. Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi confirmed the death of Maila on Friday. Motsaoledi said Maila passed away on Thursday evening but could not explain what was the cause of his death. In a statement issued by SECTION27, the organisation said Maila was a good man. “Bra Joe” as many of us called him at SECTION27 was a consummate professional who did his job with passion and love for the people of South Africa. He fiercely guarded his principal’s good name and was always prepared to facilitate meetings, access to his minister or simply to help find important information. He was always available and prepared to help. “We will miss his daily postings on love on Facebook, his selfies and the passion with which he spoke about a health system which will one day serve all who live in South Africa. Joe quietly also led a campaign to get school shoes to learners unable to afford it and we hope that there will be a way to continue this work he did in his spare time. “We have many stories to tell of our interactions with Bra Joe, the activist t-shirts he would happily wear with his impeccable suits, the cellphone always pressed to his ear while gesticulating at one of us, always a twinkle in his eye. “Robala ka Kgotso Bra Joe, we will miss you terribly, but promise to keep up the fight which you so gallantly joined us in. Our deepest condolences to his partner, his children, his family, his colleagues, friends, Popo Maja and the communications team at the National Health Department and last but not least Dr Motsoaledi,” reads the statement. -TNA
