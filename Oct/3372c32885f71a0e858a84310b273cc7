Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has on Tuesday said that it is important for Zimbabwe and South Africa to improve the local business environment and increase investment. President Mugabe said this during his official state visit as he is attending the 2nd Session of the South Africa-Zimbabwe Bi-National Commission (BNC). “Together we should look at how we can stop those who want to undermine our economies through ICT technologies,” said Mugabe. The BNC session will afford an opportunity to review the state of the bilateral relationship between the two neighbouring countries. President Zuma said that the Beitbridge border post is the busiest on the continent and that it is urgent for both countries to start the process of establishing a One-stop border post as they decided in 2009. “We find ourselves in challenging times considering effects of the El Niño phenomenon which devasted our economies. “Our struggle today is about the economic emancipation of our people. I am certain our joint effort will lead us there,” said Zuma. The BNC will further provide a platform to strengthen and deepen the warm and cordial bilateral relations between the two countries as well as to review and determine the actual progress made on bilateral undertakings and commitments made during the inauguration Session of the BNC in October 2016. Both presidents will deliberate and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual concern, particularly peace, security, stability, and development in the SADC region and some parts of the continent. They will also sign agreements on labour, employment and health. These will further push trade, which stood at about R29.3b in 2016. -TNA Reporter
