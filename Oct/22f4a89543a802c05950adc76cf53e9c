Social media has reacted with mixed emotions following Katlego Mphela’s ex-girlfriend Pulane Lenkoe accusations that the footballer used to abuse her.  Lenkoe posted a bruised picture of her on Instagram on Tuesday claiming that Mphela had assaulted her and later convinced her to delete the pictures.  “After he told me he would never allow himself to touch me again, blamed it on stress and insecurities. So I forgave him,” she wrote.          “Funny I always considered myself to be strong. I guess we all have our weaknesses. I allowed this man who promised to love, protect and make me feel safe to do this to me over and over and over again and each time he should swear,” she wrote on Instagram.   Lenkoe has thanked those who sent her words of encouragement following her alleged abuse ordeal. She says that she has since found closure in the matter and wishes to encourage more women who might find themselves in a similar position.  Katlego Mphela has not yet responded in this matter. -TNA Reporter
