Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir on Sunday extended for two months a unilateral ceasefire in the war-torn regions of Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan, state media said. The decision, extending the truce to December 31, came days after the United States lifted a 20-year trade embargo on Sudan. Sudan’s official news agency SUNA said Bashir had made the move to show that the government is “keen to achieve peace and stability in Sudan”. Since June 2016, Bashir has declared several ceasefires in the three regions, where fighting between government forces and rebels has killed tens of thousands of people. Sudanese officials claim that the conflict in Darfur, a region the size of France, has ended, but there are still sporadic reports of clashes. Sunday’s announcement came just two days after Washington ended a two-decades-old trade embargo imposed on Khartoum over its alleged support for Islamist militant groups. Now slain Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was based in Sudan from 1992 to 1996. -AFP
