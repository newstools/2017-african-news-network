Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is on Friday expected to lead government tour to various Public Works programmes in Thaba Nchu Free State. Ramaphosa will be accompanied by Premier Ace Magashule, Cabinet Ministers as well as deputy ministers. According to Free State government, the aim of the visit is to highlight the contribution done by the Programme in the current socio-economic development of communities in the province. “The EPWP site visit is part of the work of the government’s Public Employment Programme-inter ministerial committee (PEP-IMC) chaired by the deputy president,” Provincial government said. The PEP-IMC is a government structure aimed at achieving better synergy between the EPWP and the other poverty alleviation, employment enterprises development and skills development initiatives. The committee also ensures that the government scales up its PWP programmes to achieve the 6 million work opportunity target by 2019 as mandated by President Jacob Zuma. The PEP-IMC is made up of Ministers, deputy ministers and Director Generals who are responsible for the implementation of the PEP Programmes. -TNA Reporter
