The special investigating unit (SIU) has on Monday said that it is on the verge of starting the investigation into allegations of corruption and state capture at Eskom. The Unit said that after extensive engagements with the Department of Public Enterprises, receipt of the necessary documents and assessment of these documents, the scoping of the investigation into the alleged maladministration and malpractice at Eskom has been completed. “The proclamation process is being followed in accordance with the SIU Act and applicable processes. The SIU will prioritise this investigation and work speedily and meticulously to see the completion thereof,” said Nazreen Pandor Head of Communications and Stakeholder Management Special Investigating Unit. In order for SIU to start the investigation on Eskom, President Jacob Zuma needs to sign the proclamation that will authorise the Unit to investigate the reported corruption on Eskom. In July, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said she asked the SIU to investigate allegations of corruption and state capture at Eskom. -TNA Reporter
