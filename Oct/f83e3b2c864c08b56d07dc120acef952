The application brought by a group of disgruntled ANC members to have the results of the Eastern Cape elective conference interdicted has been struck off the roll in the East London High Court. This follows a chaotic and at times violent conference held at the weekend. According to Judge Belinda Hartley said she dismissed the application because it was not properly enrolled before her, adding that the respondent’s rights were compromised by the applicant’s failure to adhere to her directive giving direction to their right to be properly heard under the relevant and very present circumstances.

I am inclined to allow them to make out their case in these papers which should be suitably amended should they wish to avoid a duplication of costs by later issuing out a fresh application,” said Hartley. The application to interdict the conference comes after some delegates claimed that non-members attempted to participate in proceedings while other legitimate members had been barred from the conference.
