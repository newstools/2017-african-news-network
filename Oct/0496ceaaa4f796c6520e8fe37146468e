Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen accused of assaulting and forcing Victor Rathabile Mlotshwa in a coffin in Middelburg almost a year ago will know their fate on Monday next week when the Circuit of the Pretoria High Court in Middelburg passes a sentence against them. The accused whose case made headlines worldwide were found guilty during their previous appearance in August. They are still out on bail pending for sentencing next week. The court heard that the coffin was specially purchased to scary black people because they were always criminal suspects on their farms. Then Judge Sekgopotjie Mphahlele persisted that it was clear that the accused were planned to kill Mlotshwa. Mphahlele told the court that the accused were found guilty on seven charges including two of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Others included unlawful possession of a firearm, kidnapping, attempted murder, intimidation and defeating the ends of justice. The court also heard that Delton Sithole was the first person to be attacked by the accused before Mlotshwa and the other GHB charge related to the first attack. She further stressed that the video of the attack which went viral on social media clearly showed the aggressive conduct of the accused which could have ended up led to the killing of Mlotshwa. francen@thenewage.co.za
