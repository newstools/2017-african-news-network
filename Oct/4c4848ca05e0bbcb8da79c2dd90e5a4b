A Port Elizabeth man was saved by Police in an unfolding possible diamond scam worth R680 000. Walmer police received information from the security of a major shopping complex about a person who might be falling victim to a fraudulent scam. Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the security guard noticed the victim leaving with a suspicious man. “It is alleged that these suspects con people into parting with their money in exchange for precious stones like diamonds and emeralds,” said Labans. The vehicle’s registration number of the elderly victim was given to the police and immediately the detectives and uniform members were searching the Walmer area for the vehicle. “The victim was traced via an old case number and he was immediately contacted on his cell phone. Police warned him that he was about to be conned. A police officer pretending to be his daughter managed to get his location from him,” said Labans. The victim indicated that he was about to purchase emeralds to the value of R680 000. Labans said these con artists operate in such a way that after getting the money they hand the naïve victim pieces of glass passing off as diamonds and emeralds. Police are warning people not to fall prey to such deals and to be very careful when responding to advertisements via the internet. It is reported that the buyer indicated to them he intended to buy the gem because the suspect had told him another customer was prepared to pay R1.3-million for it. “The documents appear to be very legitimate and the conmen even hand over documentation for tax purposes,” he said. The 35-year-old suspect was not charged as the victim refused to open a case. TNA Reporter
