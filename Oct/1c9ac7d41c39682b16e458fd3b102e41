A pastor accused of raping a 14-year-old girl has been denied bail at the Lulekani Magistrate’s court on Monday. The 52-year-old man is set to appear again on the 31st of October for his formal bail application. He is facing two counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault. Police Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “The suspect who is a pastor at a local church, allegedly started raping the victim when she was 11 years old. Meanwhile, Pastor Derrick Manyike also appeared at the same court for raping an 8-year-old girl. Mnayike allegedly raped the girl while she was alone at her parents’ home. It is alleged he pulled the victim to the back of the house and sexually assaulted her. Ngoepe said the recent alleged rape of the 8-year-old girl brings to three sexual offences involving minor girls. He added that a 46-year-old pastor was arrested earlier this month and he will appear at the Namakgale magistrate’s court. TNA Reporter
