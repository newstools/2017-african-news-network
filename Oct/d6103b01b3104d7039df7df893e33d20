THE Department of Transport and Public Works is confident that the recent appointment of two regional managers in the directorate of traffic law enforcement will make a significant contribution to improving road safety in the province. Control inspectors Vigie Chetty and Nathan Arendse are joining Pat Curran, deputy director of traffic law enforcement, to strengthen the management structure of the provincial traffic service. “The experience, energy and enthusiasm that Chetty and Arendse bring will help ensure the professional traffic service the people deserve. They will manage the traffic chiefs at various traffic centres, weighbridge facilities and impoundment facilities across the province, as well as implementing regional integrated traffic law enforcement plans with stakeholders,” the department said.   Farrel Payne, director of traffic law enforcement, said the two were eager to make a difference and help to bring stability and strategic direction. “They are joining at a time when the ongoing carnage of our roads has been devastating to the economy and those who are left behind. I’m confident that, with the support and contributions of our traffic officers, they will succeed in their tasks. I wish them well and look forward to working with them,” he said. Both Chetty and Arendse were trained at the Western Cape’s highly regarded Gene Louw Traffic College. Chetty has been instrumental in training young people at the college over the years and helped bring the college’s e-learning initiative to fruition. Meanwhile, Arendse has been in various traffic management positions at municipal traffic services. Payne said he brings important knowledge and an ability to facilitate. provinces@thenewage.co.za -TNA REPORTER
