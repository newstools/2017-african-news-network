The Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has lambasted the leader of the DA Mmusi Maimane for allegedly peddling “lies” about policing issues in Phillipi, Cape Town.  This comes after Maimane accused Mbalula of grandstanding following his visit to Phillipi last week to visit families after a spate of shootings left about 18 residents killed in the area. During a speech at the DA Western Cape Provincial Congress Maimane is alleged to have questioned how Phillip has “far less” police allocation than other areas.  “we must ask why the allocation of police in Philippi and Nyanga is still far less than in other areas,” Maimane said as quoted by an EWN Reporter.  “I really don’t want to respond to Mr Maimane but failure to do so, may make his false statement as the gospel truth,” said Mbalula. Mbalula instead blamed the DA government for failing to provide the people of Marikana with proper services.  “I am more than convinced that Mmusi has never set foot in Marikana, Phillipi East, because if he did, he will know that the big challenge of Marikana is that of proper human habitation. Mmusi will know, if he cared to visit Marikana that, in Marikana there is no electricity, streets, which in main are basic things that allow proper policing,” he said. Mbalula added that his visit to Phillipi was not to seek glory but to sympathize with the people who were met with the tragedy.  “We still have a long way to ensure that our people live in security and comfort, as envisaged by the Freedom Charter, but as Amilcar Cabral said, hide nothing from the masses of our people.  Tell no lies. Expose lies whenever they are told. Mask no difficulties, mistakes, failures. Claim no easy victories.” Mbalula said. -TNA Reporter
