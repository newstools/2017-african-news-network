The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says that the march that was marked #BlackFriday by farmers on Monday in protest over farm killings in the country “promoted anti-black racism”. Farmers staged a protest on Monday highlighting the high number of farmers who are murdered in the country.  AfriForum said that since 1 January 2017 at least 341 farm attacks have already been carried out, in which 70 people were killed.  “This means that thus far in 2017, more murders have been committed during farm attacks than in the total number of farm murders during 2016,” AfriForum’s deputy CEO Ernst Roets explains. “The EFF has observed with disgust the racist marches that took place yesterday going under the name of Black Monday. These marches proudly promoted anti-black racism by a tiny white minority which seeks to gain public sympathy using apartheid symbols like the apartheid government flag,” EFF said in a statement. The march by the farmers resulted in a number of roads blocked as they raise awareness on the farm murders.  Meanwhile, the ANC also condemned the march. “The African National Congress condemns the despicable and racist behavior by some who took part in the so-called #BlackMonday campaign by groupings representing the farming community,” said the ANC.   The protest by the farmers was negatively received after images of some of the marchers burning the South Africa’s flag and some displaying the old apartheid South Africa’s flag emerged on social media.   “The racial characterization of crime and the stoking of racial hatred by some elements in the campaign through, amongst others, the arrogant and offensive display of apartheid South Africa’s flag, are indicative of an unrelenting yearning for apartheid fascism and white supremacy and make a mockery of the national reconciliation project; continuing to entrench obstacles to the creation a non-racial society in South Africa,” ANC said. -TNA Reporter
