The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) has confirmed that inmates are ready to write their final examination. Acting National Commissioner James Smalberger said a total of 211 inmates from 14 DCS schools are to sit for the final exams, a 63.5% increase from the 129 in the 2016 academic year. “The notable increase in the number of inmates enrolling for the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations year-on-year demonstrates our rehabilitation efforts through formal education so that we can increase literacy levels of inmates, thus giving them a second chance in life,” said Smalberger. Correctional Services has assured the Department of Basic Education that the 14 accredited centres will run a credible examination process. Smalberger said it remains compulsory for inmates without a qualification equivalent to Grade 9, to complete Adult Education and Training (AET) level 1 to 4. “This is strategically aimed at eliminating illiteracy, under qualifications as well as the absence of critical technical skills, which are a key requirement for one to either source employment or be self-employment,” said Smalberger. The Department carried out special assistance programmes for Mathematics and English as these subjects proved to be problematic in the previous years. “I wish all inmates the best of luck and I am confident that a 100 percent pass in all 14 schools is real,” said Smalberger. -TNA Reporter
