THE National Metalworkers of South Africa’s (Numsa’s) dissatisfaction continues with South 32, an aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, KwaZuluNatal, as over 600 workers affiliated to the union downed tools on the weekend. Numsa general-secretary Irvin Jim yesterday said: “Our members produce high quality aluminium for export markets. However, the attitude of management as South 32 is a typical example of the racist National Party of the apartheid government. “They do not value the life of black and African workers. Instead, they view workers as nothing more than cheap labour, which must be exploited.” Among the demands from Numsa is a 7.5% wage increase across the board, a contribution towards medical aid and a housing allowance of R5000. Numsa said South 32 is refusing to increase salaries. Instead, it wants to lock workers into a “three-year deal” and they are attempting to bribe them out of demanding basic benefits. The alleged three-year deal is part of two proposals by South 32. Proposal 1 entails workers receiving a 5.1% salary increase in the first year, the second year workers do not receive an increase, but they will receive the equivalent of R3083 per month (R37000 minimum) as a cash payment. And in the third year South 32 would offer an increase in line with the consumer price index. South 32’s proposal 2 entails for the next three years no increase on the actual salary. But workers receive a once-off minimum cash payout. Meanwhile, in justifying itself, South 32 said the offers are fair and meet employee and business requirements. “The remuneration packages of our Hillside operation are above market level with bonuses, shares and benefits, which also includes medical aid and housing allowances,” South 32 spokesperson Millicent Molete said. Numsa members have vowed not to return to work until management treats them with the dignity they deserve. refilwem@thenewage.co.za -Refilwe Magashule
