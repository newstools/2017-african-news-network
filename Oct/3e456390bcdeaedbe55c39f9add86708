Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements and Co-operative Governance Jacob Mamabolo says the recent storms that hit the province demonstrated the importance of working drainage systems. Mamabolo says the provincial government will prioritise on maintaining of infrastructure to avoid more flooding in the future. “The provincial government is prioritizing maintenance of infrastructure with the same tenacity as the roll-out of new infrastructure. The province requires drainage systems that will match up rapid urbanization,” he said. The MEC further said the province will be more pro-active when approaching infrastructure maintenance in a bid to extend the life expectancy of the infrastructures. Earlier in the week the storms caused havoc in the honeydew, and Krugersdorp area respectively leaving houses without a roof and several school properties’ being destroyed. The premier declared some parts of the area struck by these storms a disaster zone. Yesterday, the KZN Executives led up mop-up operations after the province was also hit by the storm. Several roads in the province remain closed as authorities clean up debris and uprooted trees. Meanwhile, Mamabolo said the Gauteng government needed to bear in mind that a climate change was a reality, adding that they needed to acquire necessary technologies to ensure that new infrastructure is adaptable to changing conditions. -TNA Reporter
