BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter will tomorrow announce his squad to take on Senegal in back to back 2018 World Cup qualifying clashes that could book South Africa a place in Russia. But that can only happen if Bafana beat Senegal in both matches that will take place on November 10 at the Peter Mokaba Stadium, with the second one taking place four days later at the Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor in Dakar, Senegal. The recent 3-1 victory against Burkina Faso at a rain soaked FNB Stadium, remains a big motivating factor even though there are pressing issues standing in the way of Bafana. One of those is the lack of key players in midfield, with Bongani Zungu set to sit out the two matches after picking up a red-card against Burkina Faso, while Andile Jali will miss the first clash following a yellow card he received against the Stallions. But captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, centre-back Mulomowandau Mathoho and midfielder Dean Furman are expected to make a return to Baxterâ€™s squad. Hlatshwayo and Mathoho have recovered from their respective injuries, while Furman is also fit to play, having played a huge role, helping SuperSport United make it to the CAF Confederation Cup final. The Senegalese will also have an anxious wait for Liverpool star Sadio Mane to recover from his hamstring injury that is likely to heal after the first clash. Senegal are in a good position ahead of the two clashes, needing just a point from the two games to go to Russia, while Bafana need all the six points to advance. Both Burkina Faso and Cape Verde would also fancy their chances in their last match, even though the winner can only end up on nine points, having played one more official game. Bafana have a chance of topping the group on 10 points should they pull off wins in their last two matches. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
