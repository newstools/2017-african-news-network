Nelson Mandela University students have on Tuesday embarked on a march following a violent attack on two female students on Monday night. One student was raped and another stabbed at the university’s 2nd Avenue Campus. The University’s SRC has called for heightened security on all university campuses. “This incident signifies the need for more heightened security and police presence on all our campuses, particularly at night to ensure that our female students do not become victims of such heinous crimes. “This is also another indicator of the bigger problem that society faces of not only the continuous marginalization of our female counterparts but also the lack of consistency that is involved in confronting rape culture and patriarchy within all of our societal constructs,” the SRC said in a statement. According to the University, both survivors are receiving the necessary support. “The University stands in solidarity with the students around safety concerns and challenges relating to gender-based violence. The University will also engage with the protesting students around the concerns as the SAPS investigation continues into the alleged rape and stabbing,” said University’s spokesperson Zandile Mabel. Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip has called on the police ministry to address staff and resource limitation at local police stations. “It is now surely time for the National Police Ministry to start taking crime in our City seriously. Local SAPS units have been fighting a valiant battle, but often held back by huge staffing shortages and resource limitations,” said Trollip. He added that he wrote to Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, on 14 August 2017 requesting his urgent intervention. “Some six weeks have passed since receipt was acknowledged, yet no response in any form has been forthcoming,” said Trollip. -TNA Reporter
