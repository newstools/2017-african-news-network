A 29-year-old man accused of the rape and robbery of two Nelson Mandela University (NMU) students is expected to plead guilty to his charges after abandoning his bail application. The suspect appeared briefly at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court before the case was postponed to Monday for him to plead guilty formally. NMU students were in great shock after two female students were attacked in a computer lab, raped and the other stabbed in the back Monday night. Police spokesperson Col. Priscilla Naidu said the students were in the computer lab when a man entered. “The students were threatened with a pair of scissors. They were robbed of their phones and wallets and one of the students was raped. After the rape, the suspect made the two students carry the computer outside. He jumped over the gate and ordered them to pass the equipment to him,” Naidu said. The university management said it spent the better part of Tuesday in consultation with students around issues of safety and security. NMU spokesperson Zandile Mbalela said certain measures are to be immediately implemented. “We are heightening security by increasing the number of staff to undertake visible patrolling across all campuses, including all teaching venues, from now until the end of exams. “Expanding partnership with SAPS and the Metro Police so as to attain extra support for our students in and around our campuses, particularly on Second Avenue and Missionvale,” said Mbalela. Mbalela added that some of the security measures include improvement of the CCTV monitoring, undertake control checks at entrances, taxi drop-off points and bus stops, undertake an audit of all the external campus lighting and Extending its anti-crime initiatives with the Summerstrand Community Crime Forum, especially towards the establishment of safe off-campus “green route” that will be monitored and patrolled. The horrific incident sparked the ire of students who demanded better security at the institution. -TNA Reporter
