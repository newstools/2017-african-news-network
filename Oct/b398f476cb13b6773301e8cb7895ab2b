The department of labour has commended two of its officials who refused to be bribed and faced the wrath of a business manager on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Lari Adam, 44, who is a manager at Royal Diaper, a wholesale and retail company, allegedly offered the inspectors an unspecified amount of money to stop their inspection. When they refused to accept his offer he allegedly assaulted the inspectors in his office. Department of labour spokesperson Lungelo Mkaba said the assault of the two female labour inspectors occurred earlier this month. “When the inspectors rejected the bribe and went to interview the workers, Adam is alleged to have demanded they leave but the inspectors declined, saying they were conducting their duties in line with the law. An argument ensued and Adam slapped one of the inspectors,” Mkamba said. The incident was reported to the police and Adams was arrested for assault and for bribing an inspector. He appeared in the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and the case was postponed to October 24. KZN chief inspector Edward Khambula commended the inspectors for rejecting the bribe and condemned the assault. He said they would not tolerate any attacks on and intimidation of their inspectors. “Equally, we always expect our inspectors to be dedicated and honest. These inspectors are a shining example of how labour inspectors must conduct themselves in the interest of workers’ rights and they have our full support in this matter. “We urge employers to refrain from intimidating and trying to bribe our inspectors. We hope this arrest will serve as a deterrent to employers thinking of committing similar offences,” Khambula said. -SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
