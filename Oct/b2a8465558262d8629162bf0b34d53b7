The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  on Sunday announced that it has expelled its six Mogale City Councillors who during a council meeting in the  West Rand Municipality in July this year defied the organisation by voting with the African National Congress(ANC). “On the 11th of July 2017, six EFF Councillors contravened the EFF decision not to attend the Mogale City Budget vote Council meeting in which the ANC needed its budget to be passed. These councillors not only helped for a Council meeting quorum to be constituted, they also voted in favour of the proposed ANC budget”, said the EFF. The party said that voting in favour with the ANC by its  members was equivalent to them returning “the public purse in the hands of the ANC”. The expelled six councillors  include :Ms Nhlanhla Shilubane, Ms Nomonde Nkatu, Ms Lemogang Modisane, Mr Eric Baloyi, Mr Edward Motsitsi and Mr Simanga Mkhumbeni. The leader of the EFF, Julius  Malema had earlier pronounced  that the councillors would be met with proper discipline for their actions as the party took the matter very serious. “As per the EFF Code of Conduct and Revolutionary Discipline, the sentences of suspension, or expulsion, must be confirmed by the CCT. The CCT has therefore essentially confirmed a sentence of expulsion as reached by the EFF National Disciplinary Committee”. Said the EFF However the party adds that the councillors will be afforded the opportunity appeal. “However, the expulsion sentence is effect even when under appeal”. -TNA Reporter
