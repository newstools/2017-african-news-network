A FEMALE Correctional Services official stationed at Losperfontein Prison near Rustenburg committed suicide by hanging herself at her place of residence yesterday morning. This was after two seemingly intimate pictures emerged and went viral on social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook. The one picture shows the official and an inmate kissing and the second one shows the couple cuddling. Twitter user Bongani Duncan tagged the Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula in a post. He wrote: “Is this allowed, a prisoner in a relationship with a prison warder inside prison?” The circumstances behind the cause of the suicide are unclear and an inquest docket has been opened. The Department of Correctional Services said this was disturbing and strictly prohibited. “The department condemns this type of behaviour,” DSC said Correctional Services spokesperson for the Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West region, Tshidi Mapole, confirmed that the officer was found hanging at her official residence. “We don’t know what triggered the suicide but the department has been made aware of images involving the deceased official and inmate in an intimate position circulating on social media. “While the department was busy investigating this matter, we have since learnt with shock that the official allegedly appearing on the images has committed suicide,” she said. Regional commissioner Mandla Mkabela expressed his grief and sadness at the incident. “On behalf of the department, we want to convey our condolences to the family and colleagues of the deceased official. “We have dispatched a team of senior managers and our employee assistance programme specialists to provide the necessary support,” the regional commissioner said. ntombin@thenewage.co.za
