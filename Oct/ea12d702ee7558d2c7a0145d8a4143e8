A 46-year-old suspect is due to appear before the Malelane Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for fraud and performing illegal abortions. This comes after the suspect was arrested on Tuesday while in the process of allegedly carrying out yet another illegal abortion act to a client who had apparently paid R700.00 for his services. Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi said, “investigations started after complaints were received concerning a bogus doctor who was allegedly operating an illegal surgery at Malelane village, Mpumalanga”. “The probe revealed that he was not registered with medical council of South Africa as required and was, therefore, practising illegally, using traditional medicines and abortion tablets,” she said. -TNA Reporter
