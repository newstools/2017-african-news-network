MORE than 50 matric pupils from a Limpopo school were yesterday sent home, apparently because they had arrived with “fancy” hairstyles and failed to attend their matric dance. This comes less than two weeks before pupils sit for matric exams. The pupils from DZJ Mtebule Secondary School in the Nkowankowa township were left stranded on the first day of school as they stood outside. The matric dance took place on September 28, a day before the week-long school holidays. Msumo Mushwana, 18, was among those who were sent away because of his haircut. “Those of us who did not attend the matric dance were told to go home because our hairstyles were not appropriate,” Mushwana said. “Those who attended the matric dance were allowed to continue with classes despite having similar hairstyles.” Provincial education department spokesperson Sam Makondo said if indeed pupils had been sent away because of not attending the matric dance, it was disappointing. “It is disappointing because this is a direct infringement of the pupils’ rights,” Makondo said.
