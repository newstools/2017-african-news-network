Three security guards involved in manhandling of a patron at a Shoprite store in Cosmo City, Johannesburg will be charged with assault. Thandiwe Chaparandzu’s assault was captured on video and went viral showing her being manhandled by security personnel at Usave/Shoprite in Cosmo City while her 3-year-old crying for mercy. Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane called for the immediate arrest of those implicated. “Those other two people must be arrested now,” she said. Police Captain Balan Muthani said a case of assault has been registered.”The matter is getting urgent attention,” he said. Qhubani Ngcongolo of Vigilant Security, the company that employs the guards, said what was reported to them was that the woman had refused to clean up the child’s mess. “As a company, we will look into the matter of how the woman claims she was mistreated. Our officers are well trained,” he said. Chaparandzu said she is so devastated and not happy with the way security personnel had treated her. -TNA Reporter
