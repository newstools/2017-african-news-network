After scores of music fans were reportedly following a stampede at the Joburg leg of the Migos Culture Tour at the TicketPro Dome on Saturday, event organisers, Mabala Noise, have blamed the weather for the almost three-hour delay of the concert. This morning, the controversy-prone record label issued out an apology following the chaos that resulted in some of the artists not being able to perform for their fans. “We would like to thank all the fans and supporters who came out to The Dome on Saturday to the Migos SA Tour,” Mabala Noise spokesperson Sikhulile Nzuza said in the statement. Nzuza said the chaos ensued just after 7 pm when a” massive storm descended on Johannesburg significantly impacting some of the access control points and the electronic accreditation systems.” “In the best interests of public safety, the VOC made the decision to pause the live performances until such time as the access points were operating effectively and the safety of patrons could be assured. The safety of the fans was paramount. The time is taken to ensure that the event could continue safely caused the delay to the concert schedule and timings had to be adjusted accordingly,” he said. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
