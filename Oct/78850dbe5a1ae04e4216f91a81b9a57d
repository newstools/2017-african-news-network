The list has the current deputy Chairperson Thabo Manyoni as Chairperson, Besani his deputy, Polediso Motshoeneng as Provincial Secretary, deputised by an unknown candidate from one of the second biggest regions in the Province Lejweleputswa and Treasurer Position will be Mongi Ntwanabi. Surprisingly the Manyoni list includes former Matjhabeng Mayor and regional Chairperson Mathabo Leeto and Mayor of Ngwathe Municipality Joey Mochela. Both Leeto and Mochela are believed to be staunch Magashule supporters.
