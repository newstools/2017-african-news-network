Land activists Black First Land First has on Monday apologised to the Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown for submitting questions in a letter to the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises that were taken from a previous letter of the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The BLF submitted a letter to the Parliamentary Committee which is interrogating state capture allegations at Eskom which was previously sent to this committee by the Minister. “Black First Land First (BLF) took the questions from a WhatsApp group and at the time didn’t know they were from the DPE. BLF apologises unreservedly to Minister Lynne Brown for any embarrassment this oversight may have caused her and the department,” said BLF. The error was lambasted by the EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu in parliament who had a field day on the BLF. Shivambu later tweeted the images of the two letters alleging that the BLF and the DPE were run from the same office. “BLF is aware that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP, Floyd Shivambu, who is part of the Bulldogs of Johann Rupert and Robin Renwick to entrench white monopoly capital in South Africa has been lying about the BLF letter to parliament.” Meanwhile, the BLF says that it supports the probe into state capture, however, they want a full probe, not a selective process. -TNA Reporter
