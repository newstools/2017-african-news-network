Mzansi Magic has denied reports that they have fired, bubbly personality and interim host of popular wedding show Our Perfect Wedding in favour of an actress, Lerato Zah Moloi. The reports stem from blogger Phil Mphela who tweeted that, Buthelezi had been dropped for Moloi, but these claims have since been refuted by M-Net’s Publicity head, Nondumiso Mabece, who said Moloi has been roped in as a guest presenter only until the winner of the presenter search resumes in 2018. “Nomsa is continuing to shoot with OPW, in total she will have shot 23 episodes. Lerato Moloi will be a guest presenter over the December period and our winner of the presenter search will start in January 2018, Mabece told The New Age. In August one of the show’s most loved presenter, Thembisa Mdoda resigned for personal reasons from the show after a two-season success. News of Mdoda’s resignation was soon followed by the launch of a presenter search, with Buthelezi roped in presenter following her guest appearances as one of Mdoda’s numerous stand-ins. Moloi is also not new to the world of presenting having presented, SABC1’s Sunday music show Gospel Gold, while her acting career includes Muvhango, Skeem Saam and Yizo Yizo, among many others. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
