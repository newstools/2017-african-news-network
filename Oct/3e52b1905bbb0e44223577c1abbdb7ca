Former Mahikeng local municipality councillor accused of conspiracy to murder the North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has been sentenced to five years by the Lehurutshe Regional Court. Eunice Gaatse Legalatladi, 42, was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder Premier Mahumapelo and Mahikeng mayor Gosiame Seatlholo. She was arrested on December 2 in 2014 at a sangoma’s place near Zeerust where “a murder plot was hatched”. At the time of the arrest, Legalatladi had consulted a traditional healer in Mmaseduwa village and had allegedly paid the traditional healer R800 as part of the R15 000 charged for the job. Three cellphones were confiscated by the Hawks as part of investigations. According to reports, the motive was that Mahumapelo allegedly stole the farm belonging to Legalatladi’s parents. The reason behind Seatlholo’s assassination plot was that the Legalatladi allegedly believed that Seatlholo was given the mayoral position that was supposed to be hers. The accused appeared at the Mmabatho Regional on 28 January 2015 where she was released on R3000 bail and made a series of court appearances until ultimately being found guilty. The Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Major General Linda Mbana welcomed the conviction and applauded the investigation team for ensuring that the law prevails. -TNA Reporter
