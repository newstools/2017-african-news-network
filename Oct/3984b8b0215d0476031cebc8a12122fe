ENSURING that people in and around Khayelitsha are entertained with popup cinema, social entrepreneur Buhel Sithela runs a bin cleaning project to raise funds to host free screenings. The 22 year old with a passion for films, dreams of making movie screenings accessible in every corner of Cape Town township for those who can’t access or afford going to watch a movie at the malls. “It’s very important that we watch African films because we can relate to those films and also give the local filmmakers the platform so we can showcase their work to the African people,” Sithela said. Sithela said he wanted to bring something new to the people of his community. The RedBull Amaphiko project’s motto is: “We bring cinema to the people, screening free movies. Exposing the community to entertainment, education and inspiration through film decreases crime as we keep the youth occupied.” The SunBox is a cinema in a small mobile box which operates through the usage of solar energy, meaning sunlight is used to power up the box in order to be ready to screen films for the people. “The power of being face to face with the people in one room and watching the same movie, has a positive impact on the community,” Sithela said. “Furthermore, it enables them to discuss the challenges that some face.” Sithela said: “If we can have more SunBoxes throughout Africa, that can help a lot of people to have access to information and get educated.” He added that the SunBox was a great innovation and people could learn from it. provinces@thenewage.co.za -Keitumetsi Motlhale
