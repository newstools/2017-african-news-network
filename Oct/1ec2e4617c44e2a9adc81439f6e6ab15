Four disabled Cape Town residents were attacked by a mob on Monday while traveling in one of the City of Cape Town’s Dial-a-Ride (DAR) vehicles.  The incident happened at the corner of Symphony Way and Stellenbosch Arterial.  The windows of the vehicle that they were traveling in were stoned while four commuters with special needs were sitting strapped and vulnerable in their seats inside. “I am shocked and horrified by this attack. I cannot begin to imagine the fear these commuters must have felt while being attacked – three of them are wheelchair users and one is blind,” said the City of Cape Town in a statement.  The driver of the vehicle contacted the police after the attack and called for emergency assistance for the victims.  The city of Cape Town says that the situation in the area has reached a crisis point.  “We have received reports that a Golden Arrow bus was also attacked and torched in the same area yesterday evening.  “We are facing an unacceptable norm where protesters take out their anger and frustration on public transport services on a regular basis,” the statement read. Meanwhile last month a bus driver from GABS was shot and killed while on duty in an attempted armed robbery in Nyanga. The City is calling on the police to investigate these incidents with urgency.  However, the motive behind these attacks is still unknown. -TNA Reporter
