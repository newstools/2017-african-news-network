Three suspects believed to be part of a card skimming syndicate are expected to appear at the Taung Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. The three were arrested on Tuesday after an extensive investigation on the syndicate that is alleged to be operating around the Provinces of North West, Free State and Northern Cape. Detective Warrant Officer Kagisho Phemelo said the suspects were allegedly found in possession of a number of bank cards from different banks. ” According to the information, the suspects would follow unsuspecting victims from inside the banks after a substantial amount of cash was withdrawn. In some instances they would target victims at the Automated Teller Machines (ATM’s) pretending to be of assistance to them and then allegedly swap their victim’s bank cards with theirs while at the same time illegally checking on the victim’s Personal Identification Number (PIN),” said Phemelo. Phemelo has urged residents not to allow any person to assist them at the (ATM’s) except the employees of the banks or any person they trust. -TNA Reporter
