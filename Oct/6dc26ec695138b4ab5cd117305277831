Advocate Gerrie Nel has on Tuesday announced that the subject of his first private prosecution will be Duduzane Zuma on charges of culpable homicide. The retired state prosecutor earlier in the year announced his departure from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to start a private prosecution service for AfriForum. On Tuesday Nel, alongside Afriforum CEO Kallie Kriel announced that they would be pursuing charges against President Jacob Zuma’s son on behalf of the family of Phumzile Dube who died in 2014 after a Porsche Zuma was driving collided with a taxi she was in on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. Earlier this year the NPA had confirmed that it had declined to prosecute Zuma as there was no chance of a successful prosecution. During an inquest into the crash, Zuma had expressed his condolences and his regret at the loss of life. Private prosecutions are only permissible in the event the NPA does not prosecute a matter. However, NPA internal remedy processes must be exhausted before the NPA is able to issue a certificate permitting a private prosecution. Nel confirmed on Tuesday that they had filed papers to secure the certificate.  -TNA Reporter
