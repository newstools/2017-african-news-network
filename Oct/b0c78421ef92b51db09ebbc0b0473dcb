Civil society organization Future SA will on Thursday lead a protest outside international consultancy company McKinsey’s offices in Sandton, Johannesburg to demand accountability.  The group is picketing against McKinsey to force the firm to ‘come clean’ in relation to its dealings with Trillian and electricity utility, Eskom.  The company is being investigated for fraud in its dealings with Eskom. McKinsey is one of the several companies that have been dragged into the Gupta debacle.  “McKinsey has been found to be part of the institutions that have aided to state capture and facilitated state capture in South Africa. It is important that we demand accountability and transparency from them.  We think we should put more pressure for them to come out clean in terms of what they actually have done. There’s  a lot of money that has been given to Trillian as a company on work that they didn’t do and McKinsey in very much in the mix of that,” said Future SA convener, Mandla Nkomfe. The group accuses the prosecuting authority of doing nothing on the accusations levelled against these companies.  “People are actually saying we did this and that but nothing is actually coming, structures like McKinsey would feel like there is impunity is South Africa. That is why FutureSA is pushing for government to act on this issues, it’s very unfortunate that it is not doing that,” said Nkomfe. Meanwhile, FutureSA says that they are further calling on McKinsey to cooperate with the parliamentary process.  The group says that government must take action and hold those who are implicated accountable.  Nkofe said that the group and a number of other civil society organizations will hand over a memorandum to McKinsey on Thursday. -TNA Reporter
