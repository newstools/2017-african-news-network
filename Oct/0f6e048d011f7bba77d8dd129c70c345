THE chairperson of Lodidox, which owns The New Age and ANN7, Mzwanele Manyi, told delegates at the BMF conference that South Africa is captured in every corner, including its Constitution. ‘Those who are still saying white monopoly capital does not exist are simply confused and lost. “WMC exists, we are sitting here today with huge disparities and some of these are even signed into law by our Constitution. For example, the issue of labour brokers will never die because it has been legislated into the Constitution. “Cosatu failed to win the fight against labour brokers because of section 22 of the Constitution,” Manyi said. He said the country’s Constitution was also captured. “The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act designed to level the playing field is captured because it favours those who are privileged. “Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe tried to deal with the dominance of monopoly capital at Eskom, trying not to renew contracts with companies controlled by whites enjoying lifetime contracts with Eskom for more than 40 years. But where is Brian today?” He said South Africans are puppets in a big show and asked the BMF to take the lead in understanding the real problems. Former ANC MP Makhosi Khoza said it was time to start distributing the wealth of the country equally. “Let’s be honest with each other. What we want is prosperity for all South Africans,” she said. Political analyst Steven Friedman said the issue of state capture dominates all quarters of South Africa, but the reality is that the wealth of this country is still covered by white monopoly capital. “For the past 23 years, we have been experiencing an exclusive club growing in leaps and bounds at the expense of the poor. Black people are still excluded from the economy,” he said. “State capture will continue, and many people are involved rather than just one family. “If you want to know what WMC looks like, go to Net1, the company distributing pension grants,” he said. bernards@thenewage.co.za
