“NO FINDINGS were made on any of the issues of the state of capture report, therefore there cannot be a remedial action.” President Jacob Zuma’s defence took no prisoners when presenting his argument in the North Gauteng High Court yesterday. A confident advocate Ishmael Semenya challenged the former public protector’s Thuli Madonsela state of capture report. Among the report’s recommendations was that Zuma set up a state capture inquiry and that chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should appoint a judge to head up the inquiry. Semenya said it’s only after impropriety that the order for remedial action would be addressed. As it stands, that cannot happen based on suspicion. Zuma’s counsel said the Constitution should not be overlooked simply because people are after the verdict they want. Judge president Dunstan Mlambo asked Semenya how an ordinary member of the public should view Zuma’s statement that he would institute a state capture inquiry? Semenya replied by saying Zuma would institute a commission of inquiry into state capture but not according to terms defined by Madonsela. “Now let us examine the question on the separation of powers, is she competent to then direct the president to hold a commission of inquiry? With respect to this submission, she is not. “We know that to be correct because the Constitution tells us that the public protector is subject to the Constitution and the law,” Semenya said. Semenya wrapped up his court arguments by slamming opposition parties for asking Zuma to pay the costs of the state capture case from his own pocket. Maleka said Zuma would be accused of being both “judge and jury” in a matter that implicates him – if he controls a state capture inquiry. REFILWE MAGASHULE   news@thenewage.co.za
