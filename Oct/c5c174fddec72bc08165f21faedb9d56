President Jacob Zuma will officially handed over the Botlokwa Bridges in Limpopo on Tuesday as part of Governmentâ€™s broader infrastructure development in the province.

The N1 Botlokwa freeway is the busiest corridor that links South Africa with parts of the SADC region, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The project will be made up of a road bridge and two pedestrian bridges on the N1 between Polokwane and Makhado. The President will be joined by Minister of Transport Joe Maswanganyi accompanied by the MEC for Cooperative governance in Limpopo Makoma Makhurupetje. The premier of the province, Stanley Mathabatha and Public Works MEC Jerry Ndou were also in attendance. -TNA Reporter
