After a month-long stay away, a mass meeting is currently underway to decide on the way forward in Vuwani. This after it was reported that the community had agreed to stop the stay away that led to a massive shutdown resulting in learners missing preliminary examinations in Vuwani schools. A consensus has reportedly been reached among the representatives from the local, provincial and national spheres of government that includes local traditional leaders and community activists.  In July, members of the community embarked on a protest to the Vhembe District Municipality offices to demand services. Earlier in September Grade 11 and 12 learners missed their preliminary exams as the shutdown continued. Over 30 schools had been torched and vandalised during demarcation protests last year and at least 27 000 learners were prevented from attending school. The breakthrough comes just three weeks before the matric examination are due to start. Pro Makhado spokesperson Nsovo Sambo said the breakthrough comes after the meeting with all stakeholders. “On Friday the 29th  we had the meeting with the Human Rights Commission head in Limpopo and different spheres of government,” Sambo said. He said it was agreed that we should also engage the communities about what was discussed at the meeting. “It was resolved that on Monday the task team should conduct the inspection and assessment to see how far with the Government has gone with the implementation of a particular decision by the President,” he said. -TNA Reporter
