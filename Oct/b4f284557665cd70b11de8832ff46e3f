International Consultancy firm McKinsey has announced on Tuesday that it will support a High Court review of Eskom’s turnaround contract programme and pay back the R1.6-billion it earned with Eskom if the court instructs it to do so. This comes after Eskom said it will go after the firm to repay money that was unlawfully paid to McKinsey and Trillian.  “We provide reassurance to the citizens of South Africa, we will support a review by the High Court of the validity of the turnaround programme contact. We invite Eskom and Trillian to submit themselves to this process too. We plan to set aside the full fee McKinsey earned on the turnaround programme in a ring-fenced account ready to comply with the court’s decision,” the firm’s statement reads.  The firm added that they entered into the contract with an understanding that the turnaround programme had been approved by Eskom.  However, the power utility now contends that the contract should be held invalid. McKinsey says that it wants the matter to be dealt with, “we have no interest in benefiting from an alleged invalid contact,” A number of civil rights organizations have been putting pressure on the firm after news of the alleged dealings emerged.  Future SA led a march on Thursday protesting outside McKinsey’s offices in Sandton, Johannesburg to demand accountability. -TNA Reporter
