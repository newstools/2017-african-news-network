A 40-year-old man shot and killed his three children before shooting himself on Saturday morning in Cawa, Mqanduli in the Eastern Cape. The deceased included his 1-year-old daughter and his sons aged four and eight. It is said that the wife was inside their house when the killings happened. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela said all the victims were shot in the upper body. “Each victim sustained a single bullet wound to the chest‚” said Fatyela. “Earlier in the day, the man was with his friends. After he had dropped them off at their homes with his vehicle when he returned home,” said Fatyela. It would seem he fetched his children and they were inside the Kombi when he took out his firearm and killed them before turning the gun on himself. Fatyela said the man’s motive was unknown. “He left an SMS saying that he has left with his kids when you take a firearm and kill your biological kids there is a problem,” said Fatyela. He said three counts of murder and an inquest had been opened. TNA Reporter
