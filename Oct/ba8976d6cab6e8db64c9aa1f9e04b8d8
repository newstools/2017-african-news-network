The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) investigating the conduct of two bodyguards from KwaZulu-Natal who were seen cocking an AK-47 and making death threats have rubbished claims of reports on findings their investigations. “The Citizen newspaper Today, Thursday, 12 October 2017, published a factually incorrect and misleading article. The article reports that PSIRA has closed its investigation into the two KwaZulu-Natal bodyguards who appeared in a video clip on social media brandishing their weapons and that PSIRA claims that the rifle in the video is not an AK47”. Reads the statement.  It says that the information that the investigation against the two security service providers has been closed is not accurate. PSIRA, however, says that their investigations were in relation to the conduct of the two guards as depicted in the video, not the merits of whether the firearms were unlawful or not.  Meanwhile, PSIRA further said that based on their investigations, “the two security officers will be served with letters of intention to suspend their registration.  “The letters will require of them to provide sound reasons why their registrations should not be suspended.” -TNA Reporter
