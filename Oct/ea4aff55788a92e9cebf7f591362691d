Free State Education MEC Tate Makgoe says honorary doctorates are not given to ordinary people but to hard working individuals. Makgoe says people must not take the conferment awarded to Free State Premier and ANC Chairperson Ace Magashule lightly. “This honorary doctorate is not just an ordinary one. It’s because comrade Ace has worked very hard, and I am very happy that at least one University has recognised one among us as a change in society,” education MEC said. Makgoe was addressing members of the Provincial Executive Committee and Regional Executive Committee member’s in Mangaung, Bloemfontein. While addressing members, he related his experience of conferment of honorary doctorates, as a member of the UFS Council, saying such decision was not taken lightly and that it required extensive consultations. Premier Magashule was last month honored with an honorary doctorate by Bahçeşehir University (BAU) of Turkey. The University honored Magashule with a PhD for his contribution in the field of education as an integral role player in human development and progression. Since 2009, the premier has made education a priority in the province and helped a number of students to further their studies in various Universities in South Africa and internationally. Magashule’s commitment to education has seen Free State province secure a spot amongst the best performing provinces in matric. -Sipho Jack
