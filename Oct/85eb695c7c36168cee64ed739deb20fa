Three of the men implicated in the Escourt cannibalism case have been released and charges against them have been dropped. Charges of murder have been provisionally withdrawn against Lindokuhle Masondo, Wiseman Madlala and Sazi Ndlovu, while Sangoma Nino Mbatha, Sithembiso Sithole, Lungisani Magubane & Khayelihle Lamula will return to the Escourt Magistrateâ€™s Court on 27 October. Back in August police launched a broad investigation into four suspected cannibals who allegedly dug up graves to get the flesh of recently buried corpses. Two of the suspected cannibals are traditional healers and one was arrested when he approached the Escourt police station and admitted that he was tired of eating human meat. The suspect then led police to a house where they discovered human body parts and implicated four other suspects. -Sibongiseni Maphumulo
