The Democratic Alliance (DA) says President Jacob Zuma must suspend public protector, Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane while parliament “contemplates her removal.” This comes after the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services on Tuesday agreed to hold an inquiry into Public Protector’s fitness to hold office. The ANC blocked an attempt to have an ad hoc committee of Parliament investigate Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. “President Zuma is empowered to suspend Adv. Mkhwebane now that the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has agreed to our request to initiate proceedings to remove her, as per Section 2(1)(c) of the Public Protector Act (No. 23 of 1994,” said the DA in a statement. “According to Section 194(3)(a) of the Constitution:The President may suspend a person from office at any time after the start of the proceedings of a committee of the National Assembly for the removal of that person,” the DA statement further read. The party claims that Mkhwebane has demonstrated a lack of capability to hold the office as well as  “to provide sound reasoning for her findings in several matters, most notably the ABSA/CIEX case, where she fails to provide transparency and impartiality,” The DA added the public protector’s office is a crucial organization and said Mkhwebane is not the right person for the position. The ANC in Parliament has accused the DA of casting aspersions on the professionalism of the beleaguered Mkhwebane. -TNA Reporter
