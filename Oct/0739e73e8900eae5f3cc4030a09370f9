The assault case against IPID head Robert McBride has been postponed until 24 October for further investigation. McBride is facing charges of child abuse and intent to cause grievous bodily harm. McBride appeared briefly at the Pretoria magistrate court on Monday. In August, McBride was granted bail of R10 000 for allegedly assaulting his daughter. Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance Shadow Minister of Police Zakhele Mbhele says that McBride must be placed on special leave. “Given the fact that the Constitutional Court has given Parliament two years to amend the laws that govern the removal of the IPID Head, the DA calls on McBride to do the right thing and request that he be placed on Special Leave pending the outcome of the case,” Mbhele said in a statement. The DA shadow minister said that the police service has been compromised by years of political interference and political infighting. He added that McBride’s recusal will not divert the police’s critical responsibility of bringing down the high crime rate in the country. -TNA Reporter
