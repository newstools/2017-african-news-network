President Jacob Zuma will on today unveil a life-size statue of struggle stalwart Oliver Reginald Tambo as part of his centenary celebrations. The statue will be unveiled at OR Tambo International Airport, which was renamed from Johannesburg International Airport on October 27, 2006, on what would have been the stalwart’s 89th birthday. “The ceremony will honour and celebrate Tambo’s great life and legacy as well as acknowledge the sacrifices and immense contribution he made towards a free, nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa. “During the ceremony, President Zuma will also unveil a bust and officially rename the Air Traffic and Navigation Services auditorium and tower after the liberation struggle icon, to further honour Tambo,” the Presidency said. The ceremony forms part of the OR Tambo centenary celebrations that are being held across the country under the theme “Life and Legacy of OR Tambo”. Following the unveiling of the statue, President Zuma will address guests attending the ceremony. Last week, President Zuma launched the OR Tambo Heritage Site House in Chelston in Lusaka, Zambia, while on a state visit. Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank and South African Mint launched a series of four new commemorative coins honouring the late struggle stalwart. TNA Reporter news@thenewage.co.za
