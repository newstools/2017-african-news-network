Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has welcomed the Vuwani community’s decision to lift a government services shutdown that has prevented thousands of pupils from accessing schooling. The minister yesterday said the department was very pleased that pupils would be able to resume schooling, especially Grade 12 pupils. “We have been very worried about (them) as the countdown to the start of examinations draws closer, we are ready to implement the catch up plan for pupils to ensure they are ready for their examinations,” Motshekga said. The departmental catch up plan will be implemented with immediate effect, starting with a meeting of circuit managers and district directors this afternoon to prepare for Grade 12
pupils returning to school today and for all other pupils returning to school next Monday The decision to lift the shutdown follows a mass meeting in Vuwani this morning where community members decided to suspend their protest in order to ensure pupils would no longer be adversely affected. With just 20 days to go before the start of the National Senior Certificate examinations, the
department said the reopening of schools in the area is even more pertinent for the Grade 12 pupils. The department said it would be working closely with the provincial education department to monitor the implementation of a comprehensive catch up plan to ensure pupils are supported and prepared to sit for their examinations. At this stage, it said, the 1 657 Grade 12 pupils are the priority. A total of 78 schools were affected by the shutdown, 26 secondary schools and 52 primary schools, with a total of more than 29000 pupils affected. The minister has expressed her gratitude to the Vuwani
community.
