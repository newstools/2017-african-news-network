The Free State Department of Education held its 4th Provincial Annual Maths Summit for Grade 1-7 Mathematics teachers at Gariep Dam. The department has partnered with VVOB since the year 2014. This year’s summit theme is “Diversity: Curriculum Differentiation in the teaching of word problems”. Education MEC Tate Makgoe says the summits rational are to address the needs identified in the province and to also address the misconceptions that teachers come across within Mathematics. “The aim of the summit is to improve learner’s performance in Mathematics and also to capacitate teachers on content and methods of teaching Mathematics. “We need to also facilitate sharing of good teaching practices and Ensure alignment of teaching, learning, and assessment according to policy requirements,” Makgoe wrote on his Facebook Page. The summit was also addressed by DR. Chetty from the Department of Basic Education (DBE); he was delivering a presentation on Assessment in Maths classrooms. The summit is continuing at Gariep Dam in the east of Free State. -Sipho Jack
