Zlatko Dalic was named new Croatia coach on Saturday after Ante Cacic was sacked following the team’s 1-1 draw with Finland in a World Cup qualifier. Friday’s draw left Croatia second in Group I of European qualifying for next year’s World Cup in Russia, on 17 points alongside Ukraine, with Iceland in pole on 19. Dalic, who arrives back in Croatia from the Al Ain club in the United Arab Emirates, takes immediate charge, and faces a baptism of fire with a crucial game away to Ukraine on Monday with a place in the qualification playoffs still a possibility. -AFP
