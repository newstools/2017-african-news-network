Non-profit organisation, Sonke Gender Justice is demanding an apology and retraction from Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini for recent comments he made in support of corporal punishment in schools.  The King is alleged to have articulated words in support of the use of corporal punishment during a gathering of educators and school governing body members at Esikhawini TVET College on Tuesday.  In their statement, Sonke Gender Justice quoted IOL of having reported on the matter, “These laws do affect us negatively because children have to be corrected”. According to IOL.co.za, which reported on the issue, “The king also said some children were motivated to perform their best just by seeing the stick”. The organization says that it demands an “apology and retraction by King Goodwill Zwelithini. A commitment from the Department of Basic Education to implement the National Protocol on Corporal Punishment in Schools from January 2018,”  Meanwhile, Sonke Gender Justice further accused the King of having made comments recently where he “equated discipline with hitting children and said that laws about corporal punishment were bad for parents”. This is not the first time the King has been lambasted for his articulations.  Zwelithini made controversial comments that led to a public outcry when he was reported to have called for the deportation of foreign nationals living in the country in 2015 in Pongola, Northern KwaZulu-Natal during a moral regeneration event. Last year the South African Human Rights Commission ruled that while Zwelithini’s comments did not amount to hate speech, they could be construed as “hurtful and harmful.” The Commission further recommended that Zwelithini meet with ambassadors from countries affected by xenophobic violence and should also develop and sign a peace accord with affected countries. -TNA Reporter
