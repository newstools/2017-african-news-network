Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has placed Mayor Patricia de Lille and Councillor JP Smith on special leave following various allegations and counter allegations which were made in the Cape Town press. The decision comes after Maimane called both Mayor de Lille and Cllr Smith to account for their actions at a meeting which was held Monday night. Maimane indicated that both will be on special leave from DA activities in the Cape Town Metro until such time as a DA Federal Executive investigation can be concluded. DA National Spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme said: “Some time ago, Mr Maimane convened a special sub-committee of the DA’s Federal Executive in order to investigate the political management and governance situation in the City of Cape Town, and to report back to the full FedEx as to what further action is required”. It is said that the sub-committee will be chaired by John Steenhuisen MP, and it is scheduled to begin its hearings on Tuesday. “Placing the Mayor and the Cllr on special leave during the investigation means that neither will be able to attend DA caucus meetings, interact with caucus members or others who may testify before the committee or attend party meetings. This leave does not affect their candidacy for provincial elected positions, nor does it affect their work in government” said Van Damme. she added that the statements being made in the media on allegations from both the Mayor and Alderman Smith is now a subject of an investigation by both the panel mentioned above and the City itself. “These statements have been inaccurate and are prejudicial to the investigation.” -TNA Reporter
