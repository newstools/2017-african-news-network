The video appears to have been taken at night and the students appear to be intoxicated. Meanwhile, the Cyril Ramaphosa Education Trust (CRET), which was providing a bursary to the one student, condemned the incident. In a statement posted on its Facebook page, the trust said it had canceled her bursary with immediate effect. “The CRET bursary programme has prided itself on its non-racial, non-discriminatory approach to supporting disadvantaged students across all races.” We are devastated to learn that one of our own family members has disappointed us to such a degree particularly at a time when South Africa needs to be embracing its diversity,” the post read. Late last year another student at the university called black students a “cancer to society” in the students WhatsApp group. -TNA Reporter
