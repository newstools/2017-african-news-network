The ANC National Executive Committee is in support of the appeal launched by the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Executive Committee against a court ruling which declared the 2015 provincial elective conference unlawful. This was revealed by ANC KZN provincial secretary Super Zuma during a press conference held in Durban on Tuesday. Zuma said they would be going ahead with the appeal, which the PEC submitted last week because they are confident that a different court may come to a different verdict and that the Pietermaritzburg High Court judgment set “a very wrong precedent” for the interpretation of the ANC constitution. “We were taken to court because comrades believed there were many irregularities during the conference but we all know now that according to the judge it’s clear there was no material rigging of the conference,” he said.

Meanwhile, Zuma on Tuesday said that as the PEC they are committed to ensuring unity within the party provincial structures and would be reaching out to the Senzo Mchunu faction. “We are committed to unity and we had a discussion at a special PEC and provincial working committee meeting that we should talk to the comrades taking us to court,” said Zuma. He said that the PEC team during the talks would be led by provincial Deputy Chairperson Willies Mchunu. Zuma also confirmed that there was a discussion between KZN chairperson Sihle Zikalala and Former KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu yesterday. However, he declined to reveal the contents of the discussion except to say they are “attempts to unite the organisation”. -Siphiwe Mchunu
