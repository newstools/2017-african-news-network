A MAN convicted on three counts of rape and one of robbery was sentenced to three life sentences and 15 years imprisonment for robbery by the Tzaneen Regional Court this week. Thabo Shadrack Maake, 31, of Jokong village in Bolobedu threatened a girl, 11, with a sharp object, dragged her to the bush and raped her in 2009. The court further heard that he also dragged a 14-year-old girl to the bush and raped her. In 2013, he followed a woman from a taxi and forcibly took her to a nearby tree and raped her. He also robbed her and dragged her into an unoccupied house where he again raped her. “During the trial he pleaded not guilty and denied all the charges. The state led the evidence of the complainants who positively identified him. The prosecutor led DNA evidence which linked the accused to all three victims,” National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said. Meanwhile, a department of labour inspector, Nwamatlhandlula Mpenyane, 31, was found guilty of corruption in the Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court this week for demanding bribes from a construction company owner. Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said the official was arrested in a trap after the construction company owner gave them a tip-off in April. “Mpenyane requested to meet the construction company at a school in Xihoko village outside Tzaneen to discuss construction related issues. He demanded R19000 from the company owner but later reduced the amount to R4000 to issue a compliance certificate. The official was arrested immediately after receiving the money he had demanded from the complaint.” Mpenyane was later released on bail of R2000. He was found guilty of corruption and slapped with an 18 month jail term or R5000 fine. montshom@thenewage.co.za
