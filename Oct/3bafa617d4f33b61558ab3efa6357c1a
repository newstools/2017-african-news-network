The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) has dropped the murder charges against an Eastern Cape woman who allegedly killed one of her daughter’s alleged rapists last month. The woman stabbed a man to death and injured two others after she allegedly found them raping her 27-year-old daughter.  The Eastern Cape woman dubbed the “LION MAMA” has gained support from the public and a fund was established to assist with her legal fees after she was charged with murder and attempted murder. The woman was arrested earlier last month and was released on an R500 bail by the Lady Frere Magistrate’s Court. Meanwhile, the surviving suspects involved in the case will appear in the Lady Frere Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday to face charges of rape.  The woman reportedly discovered her daughter after searching for her late at night in a dark unoccupied home when she heard her screaming. Upon entering the house she discovered the men surrounding her daughter. She managed to overcome the men after a struggle and stabbed them.  According to reports, the money that has been collected through that fund will be used to for her counselling. -TNA Reporter
