THE South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) says the 49% increase in the number of cash-intransit heists countrywide in the past eight months was highly concerning. The centre noted that 232 heists took place between January 1 and August 31. “While 2016 compared to 2015 only reflected an 8% increase, the increase is measured against the previous year, 2017 year to date compared to 2016. “We are concerned with the increase together with the cash-in-transit industry. First, because of the organised manner and accompanied use of violence by criminals during these incidents, and, secondly, because we may experience a further increase as we enter the festive season,” Sabric’s operations general manager, Kevin Twiname, said. The centre said it was working closely with the police and the money transit industry in efforts to combat the scourge. “The companies are constantly reviewing their security measures. “The criminals responsible for committing these incidents have to be arrested, successfully prosecuted so that they can be put behind bars where they belong. “We also appeal to members of the public who may have any information in respect of these incidents or the criminals responsible for committing these robberies to share such information with the police or the centre and cash companies,” Twiname said. He said such incidents were most prevalent in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.
