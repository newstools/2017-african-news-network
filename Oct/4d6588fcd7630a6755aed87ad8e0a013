Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has applauded members of police for the arrest of suspects in the murder of a member of the Flying Squad. The two suspects were arrested on Wednesday in Jabulani. During the arrest, they were found in possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunitions. The officer and his partner were on a routine patrol when they spotted a ‘suspicious’ looking vehicle in Mofolo South and give chase. A shootout ensued and the officer was fatally wounded. A 14-year-old passerby was also shot and was rushed to a nearby hospital. “I commend the police officers who worked around the clock to make a breakthrough in this case. This demonstrates our zeal to deal with the killings of our own selfless and dedicated women and men in blue. We cannot fold our arms, sit back and allow criminals to hold us at ransom. We will not rest until all suspects involved in this callous and inhumane criminal activities are brought to book and face the full might of the law,” said MEC Nkosi-Malobane. “I urge community members to take charge of their communities and be responsible citizens by being the eyes and the ears of law enforcement agencies and blow the whistle against any criminals in their respective communities,” she said. -TNA Reporter
