IT’S all systems go for the Migos Culture Tour in Durban this evening and Joburg tomorrow night. The American rap trio, made up of relatives Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, landed in Durban after arriving through OR Tambo International Airport. This follows their tour of Australia. During the two city tour, Migos will be joined by local acts including AKA, Riky Rick, DJ Tira, Babes Wodumo and L’vovo. As soon as they touched down the Boujee hit makers were whisked off by their hosts, Mabala Noise Entertainment, to their hotel. Local fans lined the streets of Durban as the branded Mabala Noise/Migos Culture Tour convoy made its way with fans swooning over the Atlanta rap trio. Speaking to The New Age, the event’s publicist, Melanie Ramjee, said music fans can look forward to a powerhouse performance from the trio. “Judging from their Australian tour and other recent performances ahead of the SA tour, music fans can look forward to out of this world performances. They are not your typical hip hop performers. They are quite an energetic and lively act so there’s no doubt that this will be one of the dopest shows Mzansi will ever see,” she said. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
