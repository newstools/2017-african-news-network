Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula’s usage of language has received a mixed reaction from society and social media. Some of the social media users applauded Mbalula’s strong words directed to criminals, while others warned the minister from using such words saying it could lead to police brutality. The minister told men and women in blue that he wants the police to unsettle criminals, squeeze them, and that if they have balls they must crush them. “I want to see you everywhere, where criminals think they are in charge. I want to see you wherever criminals congest.  We must unsettle them, we must squeeze them. If they have balls, we must crush them,” Mbalula said. During his speech at the police academy in Pretoria West, the minister also went as far as encouraging the newly re-launched TRT to break the law when needed to and he will deal with court cases. However, South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) Secretary General Zwelinzima Vavi did not take the minister’s message lightly, warning that Police would literally break the law. “Hayi Mbaks you will lose us with that language and when you ask the police to break the law. You know they will interpret that literally,” Vavi tweeted. Mbalula also replied to Vavi saying that criminals are tough, rouge and uncaring. Police can’t be blowing kisses when dealing with them. Criminals are tough, rogue and uncaring. I’m on my way to Phillipi CPT where they killed 18 people – we can’t be blowing kisses Cadre. https://t.co/70jChE3op8 — RSA Police Minister (@MbalulaFikile) October 3, 2017 -Sipho Jack
