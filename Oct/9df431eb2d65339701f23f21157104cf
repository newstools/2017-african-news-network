The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) investigating the conduct of two bodyguards from KwaZulu-Natal who were seen cocking an AK-47 and making death threats in a video that went viral on social media says that the weapon in the video is “not an AK-47”. “We have that on record that the gun is not an AK-47,” PSiRA spokesperson, Siziwe Zuma confirmed on Thursday.  The gun was allegedly confirmed to be an AK-47 by experts who watched the video, however, PSIRA has said that its findings are that the gun is not.  The two bodyguards who were alleged to be working for a secretary from the ANC’s eThekwini region were fired after the incident and reportedly had a case opened against them.  However, the party distanced itself from the incident and called on the security company responsible to take action on the matter.  The incident also resulted in further investigations to discover possible involvement of the gun into the political killings in KZN.  The Hawks had also confirmed that the guns were seized to investigate any possible investment in other crimes as it is a procedure.    -TNA Reporter
