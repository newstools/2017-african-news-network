Several commuters were left stranded due to Tshwane Bus Service (TBS) strike action by workshop personnel who blockaded the main gate preventing buses from leaving the depot. According to a statement issued by the City, only three out of 105 buses were able to exit the depot early before workshop personnel who consist of artisans, senior operators, and general workers downed tools and blockaded the gate with two trucks. “The TBS management was surprised by the downing of the tools as the personnel that embarked on strike action did not make them aware of their intention to strike. The disgruntled workers claim that they decided to embark on strike action due to overtime and the apparent outsourcing of work to external companies,” said in a statement. Bus commuters in Centurion, Olivienhoutbosch, Danville, Pretoria East and some in Lotus Gardens have been severely affected by the strike. The City of Tshwane has apologised to bus commuters who have been left stranded and advised them to make alternative transport plans while they are resolving the issues that led to the strike. “We condemn the behaviour of the striking personnel who should have utilised other avenues available to them to express their grievances than arbitrarily embarking on strike action,” said the City. -TNA Reporter
