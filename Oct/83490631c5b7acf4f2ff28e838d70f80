The Congress of the People (COPE) has called on the Basic Education Department to establish training systems for teachers and managers. This comes after 54 learners from a school in Soweto were allegedly sexually assaulted by a scholar patroller. On Monday the scholar patroller was arrested and his services were terminated with immediate effect. “It must be noted that officials are currently at the school to establish the facts around the incident, however, it is alleged that the patroller sexually assaulted about 54 learners,” said Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi.  COPE questioned why was it allowed to escalate to this level? Today, the primary school has 54 children who were allegedly molested by one man, their school patrol guard. “If it wasn’t because of a mother who overheard one child whispering to her peers it wouldn’t have come out. This proves that something is not right with our school management system,” said COPE’s Glacier Nkhwashu. Nkhwashu stated that what happened at the school shows that primary schools teachers and managers are not trained enough to assist to groom or understand child conversation. “Teachers must be taught to have open interaction with our young ones at schools. This will assist schools to be able to pick up these incidences of child abuse very early,” Nkhwashu added. -TNA Reporter
