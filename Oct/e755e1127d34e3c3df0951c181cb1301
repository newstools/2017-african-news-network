Johannesburg residents who own birds have been urged to monitor them as the City is hit by the bird flu virus with 581 birds culled since last month. This comes months after the disease, affecting mainly poultry, had been reported in other provinces. The City of Johannesburg on Wednesday announced that the City has been hit by the virus with the Johannesburg Zoo being the most affected area. “The seasonal migration of free-roaming birds has aided the spread unfortunately and this has affected the City of Joburg,” said Joburg City Parks and Zoo’s Jenny Moodley. Meanwhile, Thirty-six cases have been confirmed across the Western Cape. “Both farms were placed under quarantine immediately, and no birds are allowed to enter or leave the affected properties. There are around 1000 ostriches on both farms,” the department said in a statement. No bird deaths have been reported in the area and it is suspected that wild birds are the source of the infection, the department added. The World Health Organization says the likelihood of human infection with H5N8 appears to be low, but that it cannot be excluded. Even the North West province reported its first case of bird flu in September. The department of rural, environment and agricultural development confirmed on Wednesday that there has been an outbreak of high pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) or bird flu in the Rustenburg area. The disease was picked up in domesticated wild birds in the Bo-dorp residential area. It involves wild ducks and about 60 other birds including canaries, swans and parrots in the vicinity of immediate risk. -TNA Reporter
