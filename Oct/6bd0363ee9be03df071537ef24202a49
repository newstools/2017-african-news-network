Land activists Black First Land First (BLF) will intensify its protest against embattled auditor firm KPMG and return to march at the firm’s offices on Thursday.  “Tomorrow Black First Land First (BLF) returns to the head office of the corrupt and criminal auditing firm KPMG. The protest is a follow up to our march on 28 September where we gave the rogue audit firm 7 days to respond to our demands. KPMG promised to respond but has failed to do so in two weeks,” said BLF. The group says that on its previous march against KPMG which was held last month, they had presented the firm with a number of demands which KPMG has not responded to. BLF had demanded that all audits and investigations by KPMG to be reviewed and for KPMG to immediately withdraw its report upon which the 783 charges against President Zuma were formulated.  “KPMG apologise for being an agent of white monopoly capital and regime change.” BLF further said, “KPMG should reveal the pressure put on it by Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and other white monopoly capital agencies to withdraw its report on the rogue unit at SARS.” BLF has vowed to protest against KPMG until it gets a satisfactory response from the firm. -TNA Reporter
