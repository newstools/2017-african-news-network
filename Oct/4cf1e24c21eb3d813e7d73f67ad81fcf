“Izinja Ezingondliyo” Facebook page has taken social media by storm when frustrated mothers took to the page to expose baby daddies who are not paying for maintenance. It is said that the page seeks to expose all fathers who have failed to do the most basic things, like taking care of their children. The page Izinja ezingondliyo (Dogs that don’t pay maintenance) was created on the 25 October and it sits at 104k followers three days after it was created. However, the pages disclaimer has made it clear that it will not tolerate lies from mothers and has encouraged baby daddies to lay a complaint if ever they should be accused of such. “This page does not encourage personal agendas that have nothing to do with the child and if any mother uses the page for any other reasons besides “exposing inja engodli” she will be held liable for her actions. “Should the man prove beyond reasonable doubt that you lied I will give out your name and you may be charged for defamation of Character,” page admin said. According to Sowetan, Social media law expert, Emma Sadlier said there was a clear case of defamation of character. -TNA Reporter
