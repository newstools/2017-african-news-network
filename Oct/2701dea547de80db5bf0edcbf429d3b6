Spain’s government kicked off a crisis cabinet meeting Saturday as it prepares to seize powers from Catalonia’s separatist government in a bid to stop the northeastern region’s independence drive. The meeting, which started around 10:00 am (0800 GMT) according to the prime minister’s office, aims to decide on specific powers it wants to take away from the wealthy northeastern region, which currently enjoys wide autonomy including control over its own policing, education and healthcare. -AFP
