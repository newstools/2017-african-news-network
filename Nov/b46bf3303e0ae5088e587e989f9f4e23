ZIMBABWEAN President Robert Mugabe’s sacking of his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa was part of a wider purge, state media said yesterday, in a clear out analysts say is meant to neutralise any resistance to the political rise of his wife, Grace. Mugabe sacked his long-time ally Mnangagwa on Monday for showing “traits of disloyalty”, abruptly removing a favourite to succeed the 93-year-old leader. State television ZBC said half of the Zanu-PF’s national provincial executives separately met and passed resolutions expelling supporters of the 75-year-old former vice president on Monday. – Reuters
