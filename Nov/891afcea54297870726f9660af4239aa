Eskom’s unit 4 at the Medupi Power Station in Limpopo has come online. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said the power utility is very happy with what was announced at the power station. “Eskom is pleased to announce that Unit 4 at its Medupi Power Station Project in Lephalale, Limpopo, has attained commercial operation status. The unit was officially declared commercial after the completion of control, performance and the 30-day reliability run, putting all performance guarantees into effect,” Phasiwe said. Eskom said the unit reached its full power on 19 June after it was synchronised on 31 May. “Five months later, after further tests were conducted, this unit is now declared to be in full commercial operation.” Phasiwe said the milestone was achieved ahead of the scheduled timeline of July 2018. “We are proud of this achievement. It is a reflection of hard work and a team effort. Eskom applauds the Medupi team, under the leadership of Phillip Dukashe.” Phasiwe said the unit would add 794 megawatts to the national grid. He said the coming online of Unit 4 followed the successful addition of Unit 6 and 5, which have been contributing to the balancing of electricity supply and demand since 23 August 2015 and 3 April 2017. The Medupi project is expected to be completed by 2021. -TNA Reporter
