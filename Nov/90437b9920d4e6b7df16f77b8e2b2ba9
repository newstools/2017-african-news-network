The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that it has requested a meeting with the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to discuss amongst other issues Eskom, State Capture, and investigations into Police Minister Fikile Mbalula. The party says that it will engage with Advocate Mkhwebane on a meeting that is scheduled for 13 November where it will request more information regarding the new “preliminary investigation” into State Capture, which was announced in June.  The DA will also seek to find out the progress her office has made on a number of ongoing investigations following complaints by the DA over the past 12 months, including:  “Investigation into Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, and former Acting National Police Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane for the misuse of state resources in providing VIP protection to Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma,” said the DA.  Dlamini-Zuma was reported to have been afforded VIP Presidential protection as a private citizen. The matter resulted in the Public Protector’s office conducting the investigations.  Meanwhile, the DA says that it will also demand answers on,”Investigation into former acting Eskom CEO, Mr Matshela Koko, for allegedly awarding an R1 billion contract to his step-daughter while at Eskom. R30 million pension payout to former Eskom CEO Brain Molefe, allegedly authorised by Public Enterprises Minister, Lynne Brown,” said the DA.  Last month, Parliament questioned Eskom over the R30 million pension payout to Molefe after revelations that he was allegedly not supposed to be on the pension fund.  Molefe is currently challenging the matter in court. Furthermore, the party says that it will also question Mkhwebane for clarity on the allegations that she concealed submissions received from the BLF concerning her investigations into the apartheid-era bailout of Bankorp by the South African Reserve Bank.  -TNA Reporter
