We need to remind our children that embracing who they are is beautiful, said former Miss South Africa, Bokang Montjane-Tshabalala as she launched the Super Shabba & Princess Bokang clothing range. Bokang said this during the launch of the range which is co-owned together with her husband Kaizer Chiefs captain and midfielder, Siphiwe Tshabalala. “They can embrace their African-ness and shine just as brightly as the heroes and princess in other fairy tales. We need to remind them that ‘embracing who you are, is beautiful” all shades of Black is beautiful.” The launch took place at the Clearwater Mall at the weekend. The couple stated that having a child made them realise the importance of their son wearing clothes that also define who he is and that was when the couple decided to fill that gap themselves. “The vision is to create a range of local heroes that a South African child can relate to and inspire them to believe in themselves and their dreams. We wanted to empower African children to dream and not be limited to the current offerings in the market,” Bokang said. She went on to elucidate that being a girl who grew up in the rural area one of her biggest legacies would be teaching young people that they are not defined by their background and should never allow anyone to make them feel inferior because of the colour of their skin and texture of their hair. The clothes are available on www.sbkids.co.za and will also be sold at Mamma Magic from the 1st to the 3rd of December 2017. -TNA Reporter
