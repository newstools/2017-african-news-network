Former ANC member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza will reportedly be launching a new political party called “Change,” which is expected to hold its inaugural congress next weekend.  The City Press newspaper is reporting that the new party, by Khoza, will take lessons from the failures of previously formed political parties like Congress of the People (Cope) and Agang South Africa. “It is our view that the ANC accomplished its mission. Now, somebody else must take the struggle forward; the baton must be handed over. The ANC is now negating the struggle we fought for,” Khoza was quoted saying by the paper.  The new party is expected to merge with some local organisations like the Metsimaholo Civic Association and the Forum 4 Service Delivery.  Khoza resigned from the ANC in September following disputes with the party and said that she would not be led by leaders who lost legitimacy and credibility. However, while speaking to the paper, she said that the formation of the new party was not about her being aggrieved with the ANC. -TNA Reporter
