Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane has announced that Mopani and Vhembe District Municipalities in Limpopo owe the department billions of rands. According to Mokonyane, 32 Municipalities owe an amount of R5 billion. She said the department had tried all options to get municipalities to pay outstanding bills. Mopani District Municipality spokesperson Neil Shikwambana said as the municipality is consisting of both rural areas and urban areas but their collection happens only in towns. “We know about our municipality bill and we are already busy with efforts to pay. We were busy with the payments before the minister made the announcement.” Mopani owes the department more than R520m while Vhembe owes over R640m. Shikwambana said the municipality’s biggest problem is revenue collection. “We are only able to collect revenue from towns. we cant collect in rural areas that are dominant in our area.” He said residents should expect water cuts from time to time, as the municipality is currently in talks with the department. Limpopo DA leader Jacques Smalle said the party has written to the water and sanitation MEC Jerry Ndou requesting him to put the municipality under administration. “We urge MEC Ndou to place Mopani and Vhembe district municipalities under administration in terms of section 139 of The Constitution to effectively address the non-performance affecting service delivery through a decisive financial recovery plan.” -TNA Reporter
