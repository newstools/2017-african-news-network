The Gauteng provincial government has established a health intervention team to address several challenges that have plagued the provincial health department for years. Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the team has the blessing of national government. In recent months, the department has been limping from one disaster to the next, with the current one being the Life Esidimeni tragedy where more than 144 mentally ill patients died. During the launch of the programme, Makhura was joined by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa. National Treasury’s deputy budget head Michael Sachs is already a member of the team. Some of the members like, former head of the Western Cape Department Professor Craig Househam, are expected to join on 1 December. The DA’s shadow MEC for health Jack Bloom has welcomed Makhura’s announcement but says the announcement should have been made earlier. “I welcome the intervention team announced by Makhura to fix the financial and managerial problems of the Gauteng health department. This intervention should have happened far sooner as the department has been deeply dysfunctional for many years,” Bloom said. Bloom said, both financial and managerial problems in the department need to be tackled but he was unhappy with the exclusion of private healthcare professionals. “I am disappointed, however, that there are no private health professionals on this team which would have been valuable in importing private sector efficiency.” Bloom said a number of turn-around plans had been announced for the department in the the past and they’d all failed, including a two-year involvement by PricewaterhouseCoopers. -TNA Reporter
