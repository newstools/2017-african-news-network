The ANC says it received a report from the Political Liaison Committee (PLC) saying there was no party that lodged a complaint on irregularities of the voters roll and busing in of people to voting stations in the Metsimaholo by-election, which is taking place today. This is after the first Deputy General Secretary of the SACP Solly Mapaila alleged that there was vote rigging. “The ANC has noted with concern the claims of vote rigging made by the first Deputy General Secretary of the SACP, comrade Solly Mapaila in the by-elections held in Metsimaholo today. “Like all other parties contesting the by-elections, the ANC is represented in the PLC, which meets on a daily basis to ensure credible, free and fair elections,” the ANC said. The party further called on the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to launch a formal investigation into the allegations made. The ANC urged all parties to refrain from making statements that falsely accused other parties. The Metsimaholo municipality was co-governed by multiparty organisations, which included the DA, EFF and Metsimaholo community. The MCC had been given a mayoral position while the DA got the speakers position. The municipality was put under administration after the council failed to pass an important budget which hindered much-needed service delivery. The SACP is one of the party’s contesting Wednesday’s by-elections which aimed at testing its popularity in the polls. -TNA Reporter
