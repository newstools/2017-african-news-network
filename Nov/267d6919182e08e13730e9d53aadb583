Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga has on Sunday expressed his sorrow in a fatal calamity of five children struck by the lightning in Soshanguve, Pretoria. “We find ourselves in sorrow following the deviant acts of villains hell-bent on thieving the City’s infrastructure. It is unfortunate that this vandalisation of electricity wires has terminated the lives of innocent souls,” said Msimanga. It is alleged that five children got struck by the lightning in which four of them were declared dead on scene while the fifth other died in Dr George Mukhari Hospital after being transported by emergency services. The mayor has blamed electricity infrastructure thieves for the deaths. He urged the affected community to exercise restraint and allow the qualified organs of the state room to conduct investigations rather than resorting to violent acts. “Over and above the probes that are underway, I have instituted an internal investigation and pledge that the City will cooperate fully with the police as well as the labour department,” said Msimanga. -TNA Reporter
