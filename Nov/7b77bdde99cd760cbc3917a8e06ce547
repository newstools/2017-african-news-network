DA Gauteng leader John Moodey retained his position during the party’s provincial congress in Johannesburg on Saturday.  The DA had its provincial congress at the weekend to elect leadership that will lead the party into the 2019 general elections. Party leader Mmusi Maimane‏ congratulated the newly elected leadership and reminded them of the party’s mandate to take over the province.    “I wish to congratulate the leader of the DA in Gauteng, Mr John Moodey. Now, the task of winning of Gauteng begins. We have a lot of work to do, to inspire our people with hope for a new beginning. Change that includes everyone, not just the elite. Strength and forward,” Maimane‏ said. Moodey was initially elected provincial leader in 2006 and in 2012, he was re-elected to the position of provincial leader. He retained his position again in 2014 where he was re-elected into the legislature and was serving as the leader of the official opposition. Meanwhile other candidates that came out victories in the elections, which were conducted through secret ballot voting, were Mike Moriarty who was elected as the new DA Gauteng chairperson, while Bongani Nkomo was elected provincial deputy chairperson.  Suzanne Clarke was elected provincial chairperson of the DA Women’s Network and Pogiso Mthimunye was elected youth provincial chairperson. -Basil Shiluvane
