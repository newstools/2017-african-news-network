A total of 21 wards will be contested during the elections. Free State DA spokesperson Nomawethu Sbukwana said leader Mmusi Maimane will deliver a message of hope for the community. “This will be our last gathering before we go to the by-elections.” Sbukwana said Maimane will be joined by DA Free State Provincial Leader Patricia Kopane. Among those who announced their participation in the by-election is South African Communist Party (SACP) which will contest the election for the first time against the ANC. -TNA Reporter
