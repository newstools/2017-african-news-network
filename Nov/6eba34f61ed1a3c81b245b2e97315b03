Former Deputy Minister of Higher Education Mduduzi Manana’s two co-accused have been ordered to pay R30 000 or face eight months imprisonment. Thulani Mdaka and Cyril Madonsela appeared before the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. The duo has previously been convicted of two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. They both plead guilty to the charges back in October after they alongside Manana,  assaulted three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6. A week ago, Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy ordered Manana to pay R100 000 fine or face spending twelve months behind bars. His legal representative paid the sum the following day. Manana was also sentenced to 500 hours of community service, ordered to attend counselling and pay each of the victims the damage claims submitted by the state. It was also heard that Manana has two previous convictions, including one for stealing a cold drink. Phindy Louw of the National Prosecuting Authority said they were satisfied with the sentence handed down and they believed there were a few lessons that could be drawn from the case, one of them being that no one was above the law and violence perpetrated against women would never be tolerated. Louw said that people needed to understand that for a just sentence to be passed there are a whole lot of factors that the court needed to consider, including personal circumstances and Manana manned up to his faults. -TNA Reporter
