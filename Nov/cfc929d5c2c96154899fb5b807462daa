Port Elizabeth police are searching for a gardener who they believe might have answers in the gruesome murder of an elderly couple. A 65-year-old Andre Saaiman and his wife Lidia, 69, were found hacked to death inside a locked room in their Homewood home on Monday Morning. Police say a gardener who lived in a caravan on the premises is missing. Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the house was ransacked and the safe was opened. “It is not known what was taken, police also found that the gardener (residing on the premises) is also missing and his TV and lights were still on,” he said. The couple who celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary in October, their bodies were found few metres apart in what is believed to be the study. Labans said their hands were bound with cable ties, and an axe lying nearby on the floor. Labans added that the gardener is being sought for questioning and there are no signs of forced entry. Although police are still trying to determine what was missing, it is reported that the safe was open and the money and guns are gone. TNA Reporter
