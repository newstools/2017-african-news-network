SuperSport United have finally found something to smile about after they secured a 1-0 win over Ajax Cape Town in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday at the Mbombela Stadium.

The visitors almost grabbed an equaliser when Morris’ long range effort was superbly saved by goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse. The Urban Warriors were let down by their final touches despite their dominance. United held onto their 1-0 lead to collect maximum points. The victory’s sees united move to 10th spot in the league table with 13 points from six games.
