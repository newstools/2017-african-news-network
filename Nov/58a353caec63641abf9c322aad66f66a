FORMER deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana, who has pleaded guilty to assault, is likely to learn his fate today after sentencing was postponed in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court yesterday. Manana’s lawyer, Michael Motsoeneng, requested that the matter be postponed as the probation and supervision reports arrived late. Speaking to the media yesterday, Manana said that he was remorseful and would reach out to the victims to apologise after court proceedings. “In the end, justice must be served and it must not favour me. There has to be a punishment for what I have done. We will leave it to the court to arrive at a determination. I want justice to be served so the victims are happy when they go home,” Manana said. Manana was charged with assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm for hitting two women during an argument at the Cubana nightclub in Johannesburg in August. Manana admitted to the incident but initially defended himself, saying he had been provoked. “You have every right to be angry at me and I deserve your anger in this matter because no matter how you look at it, it was wrong in every way. To this extent, I am sorry.” Following pressure from civil rights organisations and political parties, Manana resigned from his position as deputy minister but remains an ANC member of Parliament. The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania said it was happy with how Manana’s case was handled by the judiciary despite the fact that the South African Police Service reportedly gave him unnecessary VIP treatment. “We are confident that the state and NPA will do its best to ensure that the violent and short-tempered Mr Manana receives a maximum sentence that will also assist the offender to be rehabilitated fully by the Department of Correctional Services,” PAC spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe said.
