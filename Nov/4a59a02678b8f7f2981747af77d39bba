Ninety percent of ANC branches have concluded their Branch General Meetings (BGMs) and more are expected to conclude theirs over the weekend. This comes after ANC spokesperson Zizi Kwodwa announced yesterday that the party resolved to extend BGM meetings to this weekend. ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe announced earlier today that the party is targeting 100%. “Based on the number of BGMs that were able to conclude, we can hold an elective conference even tomorrow,” Mantashe said. On whether the ANC was concerned about comments that were raised by the veterans gathering which convened last week, Mantashe said the veterans league was not a legal structure of the ANC. “The veterans are urged to raise their points at the branches to which they belong.”   -TNA Reporter
