The DA said on Wednesday that it has referred Multichoice to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) regarding its kickback allegations to the SABC.  “The DA can reveal SABC board minutes dated 6 June 2013 suggesting that Multichoice sought to pay the SABC R100 million for its 24-hour news channel in exchange for the public broadcaster’s political influence over digital migration. “The minutes are a part of a number of documents that were brought forward by the SABC in 2016 to the attention of the Ad Hoc Committee on the SABC Inquiry.” The party further said the minutes reveal details of a meeting attended by former SABC board members and executives, including Hlaudi Motsoeneng, Lulama Makhobo, Jimi Matthews and the then CEO of Multichoice, Imtiaz Patel. “Patel was in pain during the meeting to explain that Multichoice does not ordinarily pay TV stations for their news channels to be aired on DSTV, but he would be able to convince the Multichoice board to pay for the SABC’s 24-hour news channel, if a set of ‘deal-breaker’ conditions in Multichoice’s favour were met. “One of the conditions was changing government’s position on set-top boxes to favour Multichoice. We would not normally pay for a news channel as there is a unique relationship with eTV that everybody espouses etc. It’s got unique conditions.” “They’re supposed to supply us with many more channels and it’s quite tricky at this point in time. But, besides that, we don’t pay for any other news channel, anyway, ok,” Patel allegedly said in the meeting.  Multichoice is accused trying to solidify its dominance in the pay-TV sector. -TNA Reporter
