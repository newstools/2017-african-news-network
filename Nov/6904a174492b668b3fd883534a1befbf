The Buyel’ Ekhaya Pan African Festival is back on the Eastern Cape social calendar, with the likes of Ringo Madlingozi, Amanda Black, DJ Black Coffee, Vusi Nova, Oliver Mtukudzi, Zahara, DJ Tira and Destruction Boyz on the line-up of performers. Now in its ninth year, the festival also includes a fashion development programme that will see some of the country’s big names in fashion roped in to share their expertise with emerging fashion designers from the province. These include David Tlale, Thula Sindi, Gert-Johan Coetzee and Mozambique’s Taibo Bacar. The festival will take place at the Buffalo City Cricket Stadium on Sunday, December 17. It will no doubt be as successful as it was last year when more than 23000 fans came out to see stars such as The Soil, AKA, Jonas Gwangwa and many others. Festival founder Nomahlubi Mazwai believes it is pivotal to the sustainability of festivals to contribute meaningfully to the communities to which they belong. “Buyel’Ekhaya is a clarion call for all who belong to the Eastern Cape to return and plough back meaningfully to the development of the province’s youth,” Mazwai said. “The Eastern Cape is a province that, despite its wealth of culture and heritage, continues to be defined as the poorest province in South Africa, with the highest rate of youth unemployment.” Over the years, the festival has become one of the province’s most popular attractions, drawing locals and travellers from around the country with development projects aimed at exposing and developing local talent, while reviving local cultures. The Buyel’ Ekhaya Festival is made possible through partnerships with the national Department of Arts and Culture, Buffalo City metropolitan municipality, Fibre Processing and Manufacturing Seta, National Lotteries Commission, Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency and SABC. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
