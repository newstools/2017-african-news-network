The Bloemfontein High Court has ruled that the eighth provincial conference, which was scheduled to take place from 1-3 December, will not take place. The court also ruled that the 29 Branch General Meetings (BGMs) must be re-run. It further said all decisions taken by the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) are null and void. The judge ruled that both parties pay their own legal fares. Today’s judgment also nullifies Tuesday’s Provincial General Council (PGC) decision, which nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as the party’s president, David Mabuza, as deputy, Ace Magashule as Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte as deputy secretary, Maite Mashabane as Treasure General and Nathi Mthethwa as National Chairperson. The judgment follows attempts by some of the disgruntled members who took the PEC to court seeking to disband the provincial highest structure and preventing them from performing any duties, adding that the structure exceeded its grace period as the party’s constitution dictates. Members were not satisfied in the manner the organisation handled its processes, which led to them writing a letter to the party’s secretary-general raising their dissatisfaction. Current provincial Chairperson Ace Magashule was expected to battle the chairmanship position with his long-time friend and comrade Thabo Manyoni. Manyoni is likened to be supporting current Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take up the party’s presidency in the upcoming national elective congress, which is scheduled to be held at the Nasrec Expo Centre in the south of Johannesburg next month. -Sipho Jack
