A group of protesters gathered outside the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday ahead of sexual assault accused former Emfuleni mayor Simon Mofokeng’s appearance.  Protesters carrying Cosatu branded boards written “stop violence against women” sang outside the court amongst others in ANC and ANCWL attire.  Mofokeng is accused of sexually grooming a 14-year-old girl. He is also alleged to have posted semi-nude images of the girl in a WhatsApp group with prominent leaders. He was placed on special leave pending an investigation after the allegations against him came to light.  However, Mofokeng resigned last week as both councilor and mayor of Emfuleni. ANC and Gauteng cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Paul Mashatile accepted his resignation and said that the department would undertake the task of filling the gap of his position. Mashatile, in a statement, said Mofokeng’s resignation would allow the former mayor to focus on the allegations leveled against him. The DA had also staged a protest against the former mayor calling for the ANC to take action against him. The party had expressed its dissatisfaction that the ANC had not expelled the mayor but placed him on special leave. -TNA Reporter
