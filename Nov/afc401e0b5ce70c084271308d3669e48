THE last time Bloemfontein Celtic won a cup in the Absa Premiership was in 2012 when the team that was coached by Clinton Larsen pipped Mamelodi Sundowns to the title. An “own goal”, which was not a goal by then Sundowns defender Clayton Daniels, earned Celtic the trophy. While points in the league will be important, there is no doubt that Siwelele’s next matches will be seen as preparation for their final against Bidvest Wits at the Princess Magogo Stadium. Celtic will hope that playing the final in Durban will be a good omen, as their victory in 2012 was at that stadium. The first of their two matches that will help them gear up for the final will be tonight at the Royal Bafokeng stadium against a struggling Platinum Stars. This will also be the second time in the same month that Celtic will be visiting Dikwena as the previous game in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal saw goals from Lantshene Phalane and Tshegofatso Mabaso set up Veselin Jelusic’s side to a 2-1 win. That win for the Free State side was the second of what would be an impressive four-match winning streak, also sending them to fourth position on the log. Celtic have won four times in their first nine matches, drawing thrice and losing twice to accumulate 15 points. Siwelele trail Baroka, who before their game against Cape Town City yesterday, were log leaders by two points. To an extent, this is giving coach Jelusic some breathing space and marks his first season in charge of the team as some sort of a success compared to other coaches such as Milutin Sredojevic, Luc Eymael, Roger de Sa, Cavin Johnson, Fadlu Davids and Tebogo Moloi. For Dikwena, this will be more of a revenge mission, while also trying to get their second victory of the season to get off the bottom of the table. Their other nine matches ended in four draws and five defeats. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
