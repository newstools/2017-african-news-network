Bosnian Croat war criminal Slobodan Praljak died in hospital Wednesday after drinking poison in a dramatic courtroom scene after UN judges upheld his 20-year sentence, Croatiaâ€™s state-run news agency said. The 72-year-old died in hospital, according to the HINA agency quoting a source close to Praljak, after he drank from a brown bottle at his appeal judgement at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. -AFP
