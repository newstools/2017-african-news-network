Despite of all the rain in some parts of the Western Cape last week, the average dam levels went down from 34.66% to 34.49%. According to reports, spokesperson for Anton Bredell James Brent-Styan, MEC for local government, environmental affairs and development planning has said that having rain is not enough if water is not reaching catchment areas. Brent-Styan explained that if the wind has an effect on what reaches the catchment areas if it is blowing while it is raining. The National Water Department has expressed its disappointments regarding the dam levels in the province. “There is rain, however, the high temperatures in between rain are leading to a high rate of evaporation and combined with the usage of water in the province results in lower dam levels,” department’s spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said. In the meantime, Bredell’s company received an additional R95 million in the past budget adjustment for water supply projects, drought relief, and other interventions. -TNA Reporter
