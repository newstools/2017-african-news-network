The Free State provincial spokesperson Mondli Mvambi says the outpatient department services were relocated to gateway clinic following Monday’s fire at the National District Hospital. “It is with regret that we experienced a fire on Monday that caught the kitchen area and spread to other parts of the monumental at the National District Hospital in Bloemfontein.” Health MEC Butana Komphela applauded the swift reaction of the hospital CEO, Dr. Mahmoud Malek for ensuring that the safety of patients was prioritised. Mvambi added that full investigation will be conducted on Tuesday to establish the cause of the fire and a detailed inspection will be conducted as well. “We moved six children to Pelonomi on Monday, when the fire broke out, as precautionary measures because of the smoke. We are pleased to report that the children’s ward is intact and was operational again from 4 pm.” -Sipho Jack
