Two children have drowned while swimming in Mohlaletse river in Limpopo. Tukelo Mahlanya and Moruthanyana Mahlanya both aged 11 had joined their friend for a swim. “It is alleged that yesterday, a group of young children were swimming in this river when two of them got stuck deep in the water and drowned, subsequently, one of these boys ran to the village and called community members for help,” said Police Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. “Children must not be allowed to play or swim in the water without the close supervision of a water expert to avoid this type of incidents from occurring,” he said. An inquest has been opened and the police investigations are still continuing. TNA Reporter
