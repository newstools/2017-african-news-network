China said on Wednesday that it respects Robert Mugabe‘s decision to resign as Zimbabwe’s president, a week after the African country’s army and Mugabe‘s former political allies moved to end his four decades of rule. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang made the remark during a regular press briefing, adding that China’s policy toward Zimbabwe would not change. Reuters
