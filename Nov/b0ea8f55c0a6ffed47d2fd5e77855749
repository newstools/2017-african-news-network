A traffic supervisor attached to the Thembisile Hani local municipality in Mpumalanga has been issued with a R500 fine by his provincial counterpart on the notorious Moloto Road in Phola Park near KwaMhlanga today for defying traffic regulations. Themba Godfrey Skhosana, 41, was in a full traffic uniform and in a state vehicle when he failed to stop at a four-way intersection. Thereafter, his counterpart who was monitoring the intersection pulled him off and issued him with a traffic fine in full view of The New Age reporter who witnessed his disrespect to traffic regulations. The incident occurred as Skhosana was apparently driving from home to work. “When approached for comment about breaking the law, Skhosana, said: “Journalist, look here, I am a traffic supervisor. Do not worry, here is the fine you wanted the officer to issue me with and I will approach the court of law to reduce the fine. Then what else do you want? Let me go because I am in a hurry to report to work.” Thembisile Hani local municipality’s spokesperson Simphiwe Mashiyane: “Such behaviour cannot be tolerated because no one is above the law. We call on our traffic officers to also practice what they preach. Everyone has to obey the law regardless of his or her position.” Community safety, security and liaison provincial spokesperson Moeti Mmusi said: “We applaud the provincial officer for issuing the local officer with a fine for breaking the law. We once again thank The New Age for ensuring that the law enforcement officer also leaves the spot with a fine like other lawbreakers.” francen@thewage.co.za
