IT WAS business as usual at the Klip River taxi rank, the centre of a long standing bloody war between the Sizwe and Klip River taxi associations, which yesterday claimed the lives of 11 people, including five teachers. Taxi drivers who were loading passengers said they no longer fear death. “We are all casualties of a war between our bosses. You just have to say your goodbyes and pray before you leave home every morning,” a taxi driver said. The target of the hitman who ambushed a Nissan bakkie yesterday along the N11 Matiwaneskop Road in Elandslaagte, in Matiwane outside Ladysmith, was Klip River Taxi Association deputy chairperson Muzi Ngobese, who was shot 16 times. The taxi boss was travelling with his four bodyguards who were also killed over the coveted taxi route. “We are deeply angered and disturbed by this brutal killing of people in Lady-smith. I have instructed the Department of Transport to explore all legal powers at our disposal to intervene decisively to prevent further killings. This conflict places the lives of ordinary people in danger as teachers, who are innocent, were killed in the shooting,” MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, said. He was concerned that the murders came just days after he held a meeting to find a “win-win solution” to end ongoing taxi-related assassinations. An interim court order was granted to Klip River as the rightful operator of the contested routes. “I will be tabling this matter at the provincial executive council tomorrow to seek their guidance on measures to clamp down on the violence. “All avenues will be explored to bring about stability in the area of Ladysmith,” Kaunda said.
