The department of economic development in the city of Johannesburg plans to launch job seeker and innovation desks within each of the city’s regional hubs, in order to achieve 5% economic growth by 2021. The initiative seeks to grow and develop the labour market within the city as well as linking job seekers to opportunities, both within the public and private sector. Economic Development MMC Leah Knott said this is a one of a kind initiative. “This is the first ever entrepreneurship ecosystem symposium which sought to find ways we can use to improve the current entrepreneurial ecosystems within Johannesburg, in order to stimulate our local economy and create jobs, ” Knott said. Knott said the initiative would create more opportunities for entrepreneurs and job seekers. She said the job seekers’ and innovation desks would be entrepreneurial spaces and meeting points for like-minded individuals to engage and find solutions to job creation and economic growth in the city. Knott said the city had also approached two institutions of higher Learning in order to give their students an opportunity to conceptualise an appropriate name and logo for the desks. “The students providing the successful name and logo will be recognised for their flow of creativity and will for innovation.” She said the new business model would  increase hubs to two per region as there was currently one per region. “The city will have a total of 14 such facilities by 2021.” -TNA Reporter
