The police in Limpopo are calling for information that may help with the arrest of a man who allegedly fatally shot a taxi driver and fled the scene on foot. Provincial police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said, according to eyewitnesses, a VW City Golf was driving along Church Street, towards Lebowakgomo, when an argument ensued. The reason for the argument remains unclear. “The two had an argument and subsequently, shots were fired from the VW City Golf. The deceased died instantly,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said the driver and three of the car’s occupants fled the scene on foot after a bystander struck the car with a brick. Ngoepe said no arrests have been made and investigations are continuing. He said anyone with information can contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501, Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. -TNA Reporter
