Former national director of public prosecutions at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Mxolisi Nxasana’s application to file an affidavit claiming that President Jacob Zuma lied about his exit from the NPA has been dismissed with costs. Nxasana appeared before the North Gauteng High Court on Monday after civil society organisations Corruption Watch, Freedom Under Law and the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution sought an order declaring his removal as NPA boss in 2015 invalid. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo quizzed Nxasana’s legal representative Michelle le Roux about why he had taken so much time before filing his application. Le Roux said it was because Nxasana was not opposing the relief sought, he was unaware of the process. “He never received any papers until 6 April. He is aware that matter exists,” Le Roux said. Le Roux said that after Nxasana became aware of the process, he – within a week – had filed his answering affidavit. However, representing Zuma, who was opposing Nxasana’s application, advocate Ishmael Semenya argued that none of Nxasana’s reasons advanced his argument for why his affidavit was filed late. In his affidavit, Nxasana sought to debunk Zuma’s claim that he said he would willingly vacate his office. Back in November 2015, Nxasana resigned as NPA boss and his settlement included an R17 million golden-handshake.  -TNA Reporter
