Port Elizabeth police on Tuesday arrested two women who are suspected to have been recruiting young women and teenagers for alleged sex pest pastor Timothy Omotoso. The women were arrested by the Hawks Trafficking in Persons Unit. The pair allegedly recruited young women and teenagers around the country and supervised them in the houses where they were kept. Omotoso, a Nigerian televangelist and senior pastor at the Jesus Dominion International Church, faces charges of rape, human trafficking and a case relating to his immigration status. Hawks spokesperson Captain Anelise Feni reportedly confirmed the arrest of the two women, aged 28 and 36. Omotoso reportedly used older women to identify and recruit young women, some as young as 13, to join his sexual entertainers. These young women were allegedly identified from church services and crusades. Feni said authorities were anticipating more arrests. The two women will appear in the Eastern Cape High Court on Friday. Meanwhile, Omotoso will appear in the same court on Thursday, to appeal the denial of his second bail request. -TNA Reporter
