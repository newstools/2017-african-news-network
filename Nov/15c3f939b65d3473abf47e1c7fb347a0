As the ANC in the Free State province readies itself for the upcoming Metsimahole by-election in Sasolburg, the party has welcomed DA and EFF members back to the organisation. The ANC welcomed its new members as they were embarking on its door to door programme in Dennysville. The organisation’s spokesperson Thabo Meeko says as part of the rigorous contact programme with the people of the municipality, the ANC has laid down its programme of action as it readies itself to continue to change the lives of our people. “Over 3000 stands have been earmarked for the people to occupy and a further 2900 houses will be built and electrified in January 2018. As part of the ongoing process, the ANC will continue to fund young people to further their studies at institutions of higher learning across the country and internationally.” He further said the party has an extensive programme to govern Metsimaholo with integrity and distinction moving forward. The party’s provincial chairperson Ace Magashule told supporters that the ANC belongs to all black and white, amid him introducing Shirley Samuels and her husband Stuart who came to rally to show their support to the ANC. The couple said their decision to join the ANC was made easier by the party’s impeccable record in delivering for all South Africans. The couple were homeless and staying with family following the death of their three children in 2012. “We sold our house to pay for costs we incurred for the burials,” Samuels said. Meanwhile, Magashule appealed to Zamdela to vote for the ANC in Wednesday’s Metsimaholo by-elections. “The African National Congress is the only party that can change your lives. We are making an appeal to you to vote for us and we won’t disappoint you.” -Sipho Jack
