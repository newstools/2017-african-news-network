Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba has announced over 29 companies that have pledged their support for the city of Johannesburg’s monthly A Re Sebetseng cleaning campaign. The campaign was established in August this year, by Mashaba. On Saturday November 25, the city will hold its third cleaning campaign. City spokesperson Tanya Heydenrych said the campaign seeks to clean all areas of the city and keep it hospitable for all. “The campaign strives to turn Johannesburg into one of the cleanest city’s in Africa by encouraging residents to take care of the environment through promoting a culture of reducing, re-using and recycling waste,” Heydenrych said. -Edwin Matji
