The assault case against Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride was postponed to December 18 at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. However the court has on Tuesday amended some of his bail conditions which will now allow him to have access to one of his daughters. McBride had brought an application requested the court to afford him access to his other daughter. Meanwhile he is still restricted from having contact with the other witnesses including the daughter who is laying charges against him.  McBride is accused of allegedly assaulting his daughter three months ago. His case was postponed by the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court in October.  McBride is charged for contravening provisions of the Children’s Act for beating and allegedly strangling his 15-year-old daughter earlier this year. He was granted an R10 000 bail at his previous court appearance. McBride issued a statement following the incident where he admitted that he did discipline his daughter out of love. “I admit that I admonished one of my daughters, whom I love very much. She is my daughter from a previous relationship and I obtained custody of her a few years ago as I realized that she was being neglected,” said McBride. Meanwhile, he further said that the punishment came after he discovered that his daughter could be doing drugs.  “I found a letter written by my daughter, which suggests possible experimentation with drugs and self-harm. “I expressed concern about all this as it could possibly explain the recent change in personality. I would like to get help for my daughter so that she can get back to her former bubbly self.”  -TNA Reporter
