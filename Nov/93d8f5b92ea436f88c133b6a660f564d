The case against a 39-year-old man arrested for illegally bringing drugs from Angola has been postponed for further investigation at Belleville Magistrate court. According to Cape Town police spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha, Jason Dylan Walker was arrested after police received a tip-off about him. “The suspect was being monitored after we were given information that he would be arriving into the country from Luanda allegedly with drugs. “On arrival, the suspect was identified and taken to a nearby medical facility for x-rays, which revealed foreign objects in his abdomen which were later identified as 35 bullets of cocaine,” Ramovha said. The drugs weighed about 500 grams and valued at approximately R200 000. The suspect will appear at Bellville Magistrate’s Court again on 29 November. -TNA Reporter
