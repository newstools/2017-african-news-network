MINING production was down by 0.9 of a percentage point year-on-year in September, with platinum group metals being the largest negative contributor, Statistics South Africa said yesterday. Mining production dropped 6% in the month compared to a 6.9% increase in August. The PGMs production was -8.3% down and contributed -2.1% to total mining production, while iron ore was at -7.5%, contributing -1%. Significant positive contribution came from nonmetallic minerals production of 32.2%, contributing 1.3% and manganese ore production of 35.8% with contrition of 1.1%. This comes just a day after the third largest gold mine in South Africa, Harmony Gold, announced that their production in SA increased to 14% in the first quarter ended September, primarily due to an increase in ore milled. Mining production statistics are important to South Africa’s GDP growth outlook. Despite lower production for the month, minerals sales from August showed great improvement with an increase 18.2% y/y. Selling of gold was higher at 20% and contributed 3.3%, while coal’s sales were a bit lower than gold at 16.1%, the sector contributed 4.6%, higher than gold contribution regardless of the higher sales. The sales of coal have been the largest contributor to mineral sales in the month of September and August, with the later month having the highest contribution
of 9.5% – and had the lowest sales of just 36.3% among other minerals. nonhlanhlam@thenewage.co.za
