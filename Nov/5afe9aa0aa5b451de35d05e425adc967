A suspected gunman who is believed to have been terrorising the Amandawe community in Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal is due in the Scottburgh Magistrate’s court on Friday. The 25-year-old suspect was arrested on Wednesday during an operation that was led by the Ugu Cluster Operation Control Centre members. During his arrest, the suspect was found with a 9mm pistol, cellphones, tablet, watches and sim cards. According to reports, KZN police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele said the suspect will be charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder and five of armed robberies. The man allegedly shot dead a 34-year-old woman Makosazane Mokoena who was returning from work on November 3, evening. Mokoena was also robbed of her handbag, cellphone and other personal belongings. Reports state that Mokoena’s brother heard her scream and rushed to her, only to find her lying down in blood. Mokoena was rushed to GJ Crookes Hospital in Scottburgh where she was declared dead on arrival. The alleged gunman is suspected to be connected to a number of cases in the community, including cases of a 23-year-old Siyabonga Ngcobo who was found lying in the road with a gunshot wound in his neck. The gunman shot one victim in the leg and another in the mouth and shoulder before robbing them. Reports stated that Mbhele said in all the incidents, the suspect was described as a slightly built man in his late twenties. He wore a pair of blue denim pants and a hooded jacket with a fur lining around the face. -TNA Reporter
