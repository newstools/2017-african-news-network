DA has promised to submit a petition to Parliament’s portfolio committee on human settlements after the party received complaints about officials allegedly selling unoccupied government houses in Eastern Cape. According to the DA’s Shadow Minister of Human Settlements Solly Malatsi, during an oversight visit to Mdantsane’s Unit P housing sites in the Buffalo City region, they found officials allegedly selling unoccupied government housing. “We have seen residents in possession of documents that indicate they have purchased certain government properties.” He said they saw how some houses which were being build were getting dilapidated before they could even be occupied. “We saw rows of abandoned houses which have become dilapidated and in some cases, dumping sites. Every day, for the past 9 years Mdantsane residents have had to look at the empty houses that were supposed to be their homes.” Malatsi added that the DA will continue to expose the ANC’s lack of political will to provide proper housing for the poor. -TNA Reporter
