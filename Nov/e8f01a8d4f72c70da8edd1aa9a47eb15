The Gautrain is giving parents some stress relief this festive season with some holiday travel offers. For every family, two children, aged 12 years or below, will get a free ride on the Gautrain airport service between 8 December 2017 and 14 January 2018. Accompanying paying parents or guardians are encouraged to pre-register their planned trips to OR Tambo International Airport online at www.gautrain.co.za in order to avoid delays at the Gautrain station. This promotion intends to make travel time for families more affordable and fun. Upon arrival parents or guardians will be expected to visit the promotion desk and present documents to verify the age of their children. Children will be issued a wrist band to ensure free access. Promoters will be available at the Gautrain stations to facilitate entrance and exit processes. Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager said this initiative would provide families with a safe, comfortable and reliable Gautrain experience. Safe and secure parking is available at all Gautrain stations and train-users who park their vehicles for more than 10 days at the Gautrainâ€™s Marlboro and Sandton stations will receive discounted parking rates. Bus trips are also discounted between 8 December 2017 and 14 January 2018. Bus commuters will pay only R1 per trip, this is applicable to both train and non-train users. -TNA Reporter
