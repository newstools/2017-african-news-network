Makgabo Manamela has refused to tell the Life Esidimeni tribunal how much she is getting paid. This is after SECTION27 advocate Adila Hassim asked her how much she was being paid by the department. Manamela is testifying at the Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearings currently underway in Park Town in Johannesburg. Manamela, former director of mental health services at the Gauteng department of health, is currently on suspension with full pay. Manamela refused to answer the question saying she was uncomfortable declaring her salary. She has instead referred Hassim to the department. Justice Dikgang Moseneke interjected, reminding Manamela, she may not refuse to answer a question unless she provides legal grounds for refusing to do so. Manamela would not budge saying she will not declare her salary, to which Hassim said: “I will tell you your salary after the lunch break, to a round of applause by families”.
