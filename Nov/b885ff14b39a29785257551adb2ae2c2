Four illegal miners were fatally wounded and 15 more arrested following a shooting incident in Boksburg. Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said the shooting took place in the early hours of Thursday morning in an open field next to Dawn Park. Dlamini said South African Police Service (SAPS) members and Ekurhuleni metro police reacted to information about explosives which were being brought to the area for illegal mining. “When police confronted the suspected illegal miners, they were shot at and had to return fire,” Dlamini said. He said in the ensuing gun battle, four suspects were killed. “Four suspects were killed and 15 arrested. An Ekurhuleni metro police official was slightly wounded in the shootout.” Dlamini said the suspects will appear in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court where they will face charges of illegal mining, attempted murder and possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. He said immigration charges may be added as they suspect the miners may be Lesotho nationals. Dlamini said the police would continue patrolling the area as officials are still searching for other firearms suspected to have been thrown into a stream. -TNA Reporter
