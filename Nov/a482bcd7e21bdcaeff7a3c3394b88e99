Four bodies were found inside a house in Ikageng, Potchefstroom in the North West on Tuesday, among them a 46-year-old man, who was found hanging from the roof. It is suspected that the man hung himself after killing his wife and two sons, aged two and nine. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said that in the information available to the police, the man and his wife, aged 30, had an argument on Monday night before they went to bed. It’s understood the man then went to the children’s bedroom where he took his sons and asked his stepdaughter to go out to into the township to look for her mother. When the stepdaughter returned, she allegedly found the man’s body hanging from the roof and ran out to alert the neighbours. The incident took place a few days after the official 2017 launch of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane has condemned gender-based violence. “It is disturbing to see incidents such as this at the time when 16 Days of Activism for no Violence Against Women and Children is taking place in the country,” Motswenyane said. Motswenyane expressed her sincere condolences to the family of the victims and has urged members of the community to use available professional services to resolve their issues. The motive for the killing is still unknown but the police are investigating three counts of murder. -TNA Reporter
