Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba says the function of the board is to support the Chief Financial Officer (CEO) not to substitute it. Gigaba said the National Treasury will be giving financial assistance to the South African Airways (SAA) until month end March. “SAA is CEO empowered. The board is there to support, not to substitute for the CEO. The CEO is the chief spokesperson for the airline,” the minister said.
Gigaba was addressing the media at the airline’s headquarters in Kempton Park, in Ekurhuleni on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the newly appointed chair JB Magwaza, says the airline is on the brink, adding that they either fall over or they pull back. “We are at the brink. We either fall over or we pull back from the brink. For us as a board, we are pulling back,” Magwaza said. Magwaza replaces the airline’s long-serving board member and chair Dudu Myeni, whose office tenure expired on the 1 of November 2017. However, reports suggested that Myeni was axed as well as others who served with her on the board. Magwaza is founder and chair of Nkunzi Investment Holdings. Fakude is on the board of Anglo American. While the opposition has painted as Myeni as the cause of the national carrier’s woes, during her term of office she authorised several forensic reports which painted a picture of gross mismanagement and corruption at the airline. At the same time Finance minister further said his department will in the next months continue to address the funding challenges of the airline. Gigaba also revealed that the board will hold its Annual General Meeting on the 28 of January next year. -Sipho Jack
