Several law practitioners have praised former acting Chief Justice Bess Nkabinde for her love and dedication to the legal profession. This took place during an event at the Constitutional Court today, to honour Nkabinde for the 12 years she served the court. Nkabinde will be retiring at the end of the year after the completion of the prescribed term. The acting chief justice thanked South Africans for giving her an opportunity to serve the country. “I would like to thank my friends, family and colleagues for the support they have given me. I thank my children and husband for putting up with my absenteeism while I served the nation.” She also thanked the community of Mahikeng for supporting and nurturing her into the person she is today. Nkabinde was appointed as acting Deputy Chief Justice in May 2016 following the retirement of Dikgang Moseneke, becoming the first woman to take over the post. Several speakers at the Constitutional Court today painted a glowing picture of her, thanking her for her contribution to justice and the judiciary. The Black Lawyers Association(BLA) lauded Nkabinde for her commitment to justice and called for her to continue playing a role in the justice system. Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Thandi Modise thanked Nkabinde for championing the course for women. Nkabinde, who hails from the North West, obtained a BProc degree at the University of Zululand in 1983 and an LLB from the University of the North West in 1986. She previously worked as a legal adviser to the Bophuthatswana government for four years before becoming an advocate in 1988. She worked at the North West Bar for 10 years before her first appointment as an acting judge in 1999. -TNA Reporter
