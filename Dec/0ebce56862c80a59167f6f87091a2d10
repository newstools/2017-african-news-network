In his final political report of the ANC, outgoing president Jacob Zuma chose to tackle some of his detractors with the Tripartite Alliance. Speaking to delegates of the national elective conference, currently underway in at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg, Zuma said personal differences between leaders had “unfortunately” been elevated to the level of organisational disagreements. “That is absolutely unacceptable,” Zuma said. The Tripartite Alliance has been under considerable strain in the run up to the national conference. Trade union federation Cosatu has made consistent calls for Zuma to vacate his office. The union has also participated in a number of anti-Zuma marches. On Saturday, Zuma said he had been particularly “disturbed” by Cosatu’s decision that he be banned from addressing its May Day celebrations and subsequent events.

However, towards the end of his political report, a more conciliatory Zuma told those gathered that he bore no grudges against anyone. “I understand that it is all politics and I want you to know that you are my comrades and I bear no grudges to any of you.” -Siphiwe Mchunu
