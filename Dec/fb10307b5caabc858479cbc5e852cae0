A woman died and 17 people sustained injuries when a taxi rolled, ejecting most of its occupants, off the R82 in Walkerville, south of Johannesburg, at the weekend. On arrival, paramedics found the taxi lying on its side on a gravel road and passengers were found lying outside the vehicle. One woman had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Sadly, she was declared dead at the scene. “Three were found to have sustained critical injuries while 14 had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate,” ER24 said. All patients were treated for their injuries before being transported to a nearby hospital. The cause of the accident is not yet known and has formed part of a South African Police Service investigation. -TNA Reporter
