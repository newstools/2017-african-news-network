The People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA) says it is disturbed by the appointment of former Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training Mduduzi Manana as an ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) member. This comes after the ANC’s announcement of its NEC at its 54th National Elective Conference at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg on Wednesday. POWA Executive Director Nhlanhla Mokwena said Manana’s appointment as an NEC member showed that the ANC didn’t take violence against women and girls in South Africa seriously. “Manana’s appointment in the NEC is not surprising because the party appointed President Jacob Zuma during the Kwezi rape matter. It shows that the biggest political organisation doesn’t have the political will to protect women and girls from violence,” Mokwena said. In August, Manana resigned from his post after several gender activists asked him to step down. Manana faced court action following his assault of a woman at a nightclub in Fourways, Johannesburg. During his trial, Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy ordered that Manana pay a R100 000 fine or spend 12 months behind bars. His legal representative the following day paid his R100 000 fine in cash at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. Manana was convicted on three counts of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges. “Violence against women has reached epidemic proportions in South Africa and we need political will.” -TNA Reporter
