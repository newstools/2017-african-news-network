The controversial pastor, Paseka (Mboro) Motsoeneng’s case of common assault against an Ekurhuleni Emergency Service female paramedic will only be heard next month. This follows an alleged altercation at his Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong on Sunday, where Mboro allegedly assaulted the driver of an ambulance who was called out to attend to a young child who collapsed at his church in Katlehong. The child’s mother Nontombi Gwam on Wednesday also opened a case of culpable homicide against the paramedics after her three-year-old daughter died. Gwam explained in a statement that she turned to the church after nurses at the Daveyton Clinic turned her away on Saturday‚ claiming they didn’t have drips for the child who had diarrhoea. She said she could not go to the hospital because she did not get a referral letter from the clinic’s nurses. Police have been given 14 days to bring the case against Motsoeneng to court. The police’s Lesetja Mathobela said Mboro was arrested on Wednesday but is out on a warning since the charge against him is common assault. The matter was not on the court roll when Mboro arrived for his first appearance yesterday morning. The Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, William Ntladi said the child was declared dead at the scene. “There was a misunderstanding between the driver of the ambulance and the pastor when the pastor manhandled the lady.” Ntladi said that a confrontation ensued between the crew and the pastor during which a female ambulance driver was manhandled on the scene by the pastor, supported by the congregation. “Information received by police is that a mother took her child to church to be prayed for. The child then vomited and an ambulance was called,” Mathobela said an altercation began after churchgoers accused the ambulance crew of arriving late. “It has been confirmed that the child died in church,” Mathobela said.
