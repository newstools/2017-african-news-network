Public Service and Administration Minister Faith Muthambi will embark on an unannounced visit to front line service delivery points at the Diepsloot Youth Centre in Johannesburg on Wednesday. In a statement, department spokesperson Pfarelo Maduguma said the visit would form part of a programme aimed at assessing the quality of service that public service institutions render to the community. “It will thus give the government an opportunity to improve service delivery after identifying areas where there are deficiencies. The announced visits will be on both internal and external clients,” Maduguma said. Muthambi will also visit some households where the Memeza household alarms were installed by the Centre of Public Service Innovation, The Innovation Hub and the South African Police Service. Maduguma said the alarms are linked directly to sector policing vehicles, CPF members and the Diepsloot police station. -TNA Reporter
