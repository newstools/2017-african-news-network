Veteran music producer Robbie Malinga did not die of anaemia as previously reported, but instead, he succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Malinga’s brother Bheki said this during a press briefing at the music maestro’s Dainfern home yesterday morning. Friends TK Nciza, Doc Shebeleza, Oscar Mlangeni and a representative from Universal Music Group, were among those gathered for the announcement of both the memorial and funeral arrangements. “We learnt of his condition in June last year and by the time we found out, it was already at stage four so you can imagine how devastated we were,” the musician’s brother said. “Fortunately we are a close-knit family and the support we have been receiving from both sides of the families has helped us cope with the fact that he died.” His father, Coleman Malinga, said he would forever miss his voice and impeccable dress sense. “We were all devastated, but he was strong about it even though at times he was ill,” his father said. Speaking to The New Age, former TS Records executive DJ Sbu, who worked closely with Robie Malinga, said he was proud to have worked with such a humble producer whose mission was to develop stars rather than make himself a star. “He was the greatest of all time. He was our own Quincy Jones and our own icon. In terms of numbers he’s probably the highest selling SA music producer in the same league as Chicco Twala with Brenda Fassie,” Sbu said. His memorial service will be at Grace Bible Church in Soweto tomorrow and the funeral service will be at Rhema Bible Church in Randburg on Tuesday. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
