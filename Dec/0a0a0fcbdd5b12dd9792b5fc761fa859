GAUTENG police have joined forces with the Department of Justice to enforce B-crimes, a programme aimed at clamping down on alcohol-related crime. B-crimes include drinking in public, drunken driving and drunkenness. This follows the deaths of four victims in four separate incidents in the Nomzamo Park area in Orlando, Soweto, recently. Police spokesperson Brig Mathapelo Peters said while investigating the deaths, the police deduced some similarities in the four incidents. “The incidents occurred at shebeens or taverns, the patrons were mostly heavily intoxicated at the time of the random shootings, the shootings happened at about the same time of night or early morning, and the shots came from either persons on foot or from a vehicle driving past the respective tavern,” Peters said. She said a joint crime prevention operation was carried out on December 16 that resulted in five peoplebeing issued “admission of guilt” fines after being arrested and appearing in court, while an additional 19 people now have warrants of arrest hanging over their heads after failing to appear in court for their respective B-Crimes. Ten of those arrested for drunkenness were released after the police were satisfied they had sobered up. All suspects were arrested for either drinking in public, drunken driving or drunkenness. The police are concerned that they have not been able to arrest suspects for the murders yet, as witnesses have been unable to recall the events preceding and during the shootings due to their state of intoxication at the time of the incidents. “We are bringing this to the attention of the public to caution them that while they set out to enjoy the festive season, they must do so responsibly, otherwise they will be arrested and earn themselves unnecessary criminal records, compromising among other things, their future career prospects,”Gauteng’s provincial commissioner of police, Lt- Gen Deliwe De Lange, said. kutullom@thenewage.co.za
