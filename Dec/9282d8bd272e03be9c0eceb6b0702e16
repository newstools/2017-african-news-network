Two suspects have been arrested for being in possession of a hijacked car and illegal firearm. The Harare South African Police Service (Saps) Tracing Team made the arrests in the early hours of Tuesday morning on Japhta Masemola road, Makhaza, Khayelitsha. The Saps Tracing Team was on vehicle patrols in the area when officials spotted a suspicious silver VW Golf 5. When the police approached the car to do a spot check, the driver and his passenger jumped out and fled. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said the suspects were caught by members of the tracing team and taken back to the vehicle they’d abandoned. “Upon searching the vehicle, the team recovered a Rossi 38 Special revolver loaded with four lives rounds,” Van Wyk said. In a statement, Van Wyk said further investigations revealed that the vehicle was reported as hijacked in Delft recently. Both suspects, who are aged 29, are expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court once they have officially been charged. Meanwhile, the Saps Tracing Team also arrested a 33-year-old suspect on Tuesday morning while conducting a trace of known suspects. The police searched the house where the man was arrested and recovered a Norinco pistol loaded with eight live rounds. Further investigations revealed that the firearm had been taken from a G4S security guard during a cash-in-transit heist in June. Van Wyk said the suspect had been linked to a number of criminal activities including murder, attempted murder and robbery. The suspect is expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court after he has officially been charged. “Police management is pleased with the vigilance of the police officials and thus sends a strong message that there is no space for criminals in our society. We will further hunt down those who have committed crimes and bring them to book.” an Wyk said. -TNA Reporter
