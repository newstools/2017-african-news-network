The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has conveyed its condolences to the families of six people who lost their lives when a truck ploughed into three cars in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. The accident took place on the R61 near Palm Beach between Margate and Port Edward where six people, including a traffic officer, were killed. Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said they were saddened by the deaths and were wishing the five other people injured in the accident a speedy recovery. “We are saddened by the tragic loss of lives and appeal to motorists to check the roadworthiness of their vehicles before taking to the road, to prevent the unnecessary loss of lives,” Mahlangu said. Mahlangu cautioned against fatigue, which he said was another major cause of accidents during the holidays. “One death on our roads is a death too many.” He also called on motorists to take breaks every two hours. According to Mahlangu, the traffic officer killed was on duty at a vehicle checkpoint when the truck allegedly lost control and ploughed into the officer and vehicles in front of it. Mahlangu has also urged South Africans to exercise caution and to look after their children as they bring in the new year. “Parents should at all material times know where their children are to ensure their safety. Adherence to strict adult supervision and consideration for animals should accompany fireworks display.” -TNA Reporter
