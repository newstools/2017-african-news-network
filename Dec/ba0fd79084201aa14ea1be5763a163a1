Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi says his department has the monumental task of improving the behaviour of road users and safety on South Africa’s roads. The minister said this during the launch of his department’s festive season campaign in Bela-Bela in Limpopo on Tuesday. “The surge in festive season fatalities in the last three years from 1,587 in 2014/15 to 2,006 in 2016/17 shows the need for a zero-tolerance approach from law enforcement on the road,” Maswanganyi said. Maswanganyi also touched on the five provinces, namely Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga, which are still a concern when it comes to fatalities during the festive season and last year accounted for 73% of road deaths. The government has committed to combating this by removing unfit drivers and vehicles from the road. “Those that do not adhere to the standards will not leave the provinces of their origin. Residential areas such as suburban, township and village roads will be policed to ensure that holidaymakers do not cause unnecessary crashes. A deeper analysis shows that several crashes take place between 3 pm and midnight and again in the mornings between 4 am and 7 am. “I would like to make a clarion call for us to get back to basics and direct our efforts at high-risk violations occurring at certain times and places that lead to an increased number of accidents.” The minister has strongly condemned acts of criminality, such as motorists bribing officers of the law. “I urge all motorists to treat our traffic officers with respect and dignity. Let us all bear in mind that traffic officers have chosen this career to serve and protect the nation against lawlessness.” -TNA Reporter
