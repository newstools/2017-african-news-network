US Ambassador Nikki Haley on Monday slammed as “an insult” a UN draft resolution rejecting the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital after blocking it with a veto. “What we witnessed here today in the Security Council is an insult. It won’t be forgotten,” said Haley, describing the measure as “one more example of the United Nations doing more harm than good in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” -AFP
