LINDIWE Sisulu was born in Johannesburg on May 10, 1954. She is the daughter of ANC veterans, Walter and Albertina Sisulu. In 1971, Sisulu completed her form 5 and enrolled for an Advanced Level course at the Waterfield school in Swaziland. Sisulu studied Latin in preparation to study law at the Leeds University in London. However, her dream was shattered when the South African regime denied her a passport to travel to England. This left her with no option but to enrol for a degree in Swaziland, majoring in history and politics. Her studies were briefly interrupted when she was arrested in Johannesburg on June 13, 1976. She eventually obtained both her BA degree and honours degree at the University of Swaziland. Sisulu became editor of Times of Swaziland before teaching, first at Manzini High School and then at the Manzini Teachers’ Training College. She later enrolled for an MA at the University of York, where she also completed her MPhil in 1989. In 1990, after the unbanning of the ANC and other political organisations, Sisulu returned to South Africa and resumed work as personal assistant to Jacob Zuma and thereafter as an administrator in the ANC’s Department of Intelligence and Security. She has worked as chief administrator of the ANC at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa and as a consultant for Unesco’s Children’s Rights Committee. In 1992 she was awarded the Human Rights Centre fellowship in Geneva. In 2001, Sisulu was deployed to head the Department of Intelligence. She is currently national Minister of Housing. Sisulu holds the following positions: • Member of Parliament since 1994. • Member of the National Executive Committee of the ANC. • Board member of the Nelson Mandela Foundation.
