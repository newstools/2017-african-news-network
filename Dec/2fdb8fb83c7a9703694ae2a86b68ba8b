Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other dignitaries will attend a Thursday memorial service for pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his wife Honey, who were found strangled to death in their Toronto home. The service for “family, friends and dignitaries” will also be open to the public at the International Centre in Mississauga, near Toronto, the family announced Tuesday. Trudeau’s office confirmed that the prime minister would attend. The 75-year-old founder of generic drug company Apotex and his 70-year-old wife were found dead Friday in the basement pool area of their luxury Toronto home. Post-mortem examinations determined they died of strangulation. Authorities said they are investigating the “suspicious” deaths, but stopped short of calling them homicides. Local media cited police as saying their deaths may have been a murder-suicide, a theory that was reportedly rejected by their children. Investigators were still at the scene on Tuesday, according to television images. -AFP
