Five people are due to appear at the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court for illegal possession of drugs. The suspects were arrested early hours of Friday morning when the City of Johannesburg conducted a crime prevention operation in two hijacked and bad properties in Hillbrow and Berea. City’s Siyanda Makhubo confirmed that five suspects were arrested for illegal possession of drugs and 20 cases of alcohol were also confiscated during the operation. “Hijacked properties are one of the challenges we are faced with in the City but we are pleased with the strides we are making in addressing the challenge.” Last month, three properties that were hijacked were handed back to the rightful owners. “We are going to intensify these raids working the various stakeholders. This is a period where property hijackers take advantage of the fact that people go away on holiday and hijack their properties,” said Makhubo. The City has conducted an audit of some 500 bad buildings, about 134 of which are confirmed as hijacked. 24 of the 500 bad buildings belong to the City. “We are committed to ensuring that we stop the rot in our inner city and make it a prosperous and inclusive place for our people to live work and play,” Makhubo said. -TNA Reporter
