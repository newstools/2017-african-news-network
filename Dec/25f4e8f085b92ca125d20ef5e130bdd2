Free State ANC has until the end of today to file responding papers at the Bloemfontein High Court after four members asked the court to disband the recently elected provincial leadership. The four members have called for the court to ban all 409 Free State ANC from attending the elective conference or participating as voting delegates. Last month, the high court ruled that 29 Branch General meetings (BGMs) were unconstitutional and interdicted the provincial conference from taking place. It ruled that the provincial conference could only be held when all 29 BGMs have re-run meetings in a lawful way. During that PEC meeting, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma was declared as Free State’s preferred presidential candidate. They also requested that all outcomes of the PEC be nullified, declared unconstitutional and unlawful. The applicants requested the court to also declare the decisions and resolutions taken during the recent elective conference declared unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid. They say in the motion filed the outcome of the PEC which elected Ace Magashule as chairman be nullified and declared unconstitutional and unlawful. During the conference, long-serving Magashule was declared as the chairman after his rival Thabo Manyoni declined the nomination. The members also requested that the court declare all delegates who were elected over the weekend’s PEC meeting be held in contempt of court. The case is expected to be heard on Thursday after the applicants requested that it be heard on urgent basis. Alternatively, they are asking that the ANC Free State be interdicted from allowing or sanctioning the attendance or participation of branch delegates elected at any of the unlawful meetings. -TNA Reporter
