Rustenburg police are investigating cases of public violence and attempted murder after security guards allegedly fired rubber bullets and live ammunition at protesting residents. Residents of Waterkloof Hills Estate claim security guards shot them while they were protesting against their dismissal at the mine. The Rustenburg municipality reportedly disconnected electricity on 15 December because of water payment issues. Itâ€™s understood residents were unaware of the non-payment for water because the company deducts money for water from their salaries. It is reported that 30 people were fired for participating in an illegal strike but residents are concerned about their dismissal as they say the strike had nothing to do with their work. -TNA Reporter
