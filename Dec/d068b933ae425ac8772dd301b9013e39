With only a few days left before the ANC elective conference begins, President Jacob Zuma says he is happy that he will soon vacate the hot seat. Commenting on the conference, set to begin on 16 December, Zuma said that in a little over a week, he would be gone. “Zuma won’t be the president. He is very happy. You don’t know how happy he is,” Zuma said. The president was addressing delegates at the Energy Indaba in Midrand, Johannesburg on Thursday. He said that he was aware that the upcoming conference and its outcomes were currently viewed with great interest and anxiety within society. “In my capacity as president of the ANC, let me assure you that everything possible is being done to ensure a successful conference and transition to the future. “The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the governing party held its last ordinary meeting this past weekend and it was one of the warmest, most productive and most comradely meetings we have ever held.” The outgoing president said His recent meeting with all seven presidential hopefuls had been very productive and they had all committed to ensuring that the conference is a success. Zuma said he would work alongside his colleagues to ensure that there was a “seamless handover to the new leadership.” “We need to unite as a nation and ensure that we face the challenges together and find solutions together, as we build a prosperous South Africa.” The 54th ANC national elective conference will take place from 16-20 December at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg. Currently, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is in the lead to become ANC president after receiving 1860 nominations while his closest rival Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has 1330. -Siphiwe Mchunu
