An 18-year-old suspect is due to appear at the Athlone Magistrates’ Court on Thursday for hijacking. It is alleged that the suspect hijacked a stationary vehicle at Lansdowne Road in Browns Farm, Western Cape together with his two accomplices. Provincial police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said the three had approached the vehicle with a firearm pointed at the driver and instructed him and the passenger to get out of the vehicle. “The vehicle was later recovered at Minxi Street in Browns Farm, where it was abandoned with two tyres removed.” The police believe that the suspect could be linked to another hijacking incident which occurred on the same day. Meanwhile, a 20-year-old woman from Browns Farm is also expected to appear in court for hose robbery. Van Wyk said the suspect went to her friend’s house on Sunday, accompanied by two men unknown to the victim. “The suspect knocked and when her friend opened the door, she and the two men walked in and took the victim’s belongings; including flat screen TV, two pairs of shoes and a bag. “Police followed up on the suspect and arrested her on Tuesday. She will appear in court on charges of house robbery. We are still hot on the heels of the four outstanding suspects from both cases.” -TNA Reporter
