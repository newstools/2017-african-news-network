The ANC has taken a decision to decriminalise sex work. The announcement was made after members at the ruling party’s 54th National Elective Conference discussed policy issues around social transformation. The decision was taken despite the ANC rejecting a proposal by Gauteng delegates at the party’s national policy conference in July, to have sex work decriminalised. The delegates had called for the partial decriminalisation of sex work. The ANC’s elective conference is taking place at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg and comes to an end this evening. -TNA Reporter
