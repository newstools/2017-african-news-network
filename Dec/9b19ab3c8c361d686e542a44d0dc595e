Gauteng police nabbed five suspects and recovered four unlicensed firearms and ammunition in Kingsway, Benoni on Tuesday night. The Ekurhuleni Central Tactical Team received information about a planned business robbery in the area. The police reacted quickly, kept observations and spotted a suspicious vehicle with five occupants inside. Ekurhuleni police spokesperson Colonel Mack Mngomezulu said that when suspects noticed that the police were paying attention to them, they attempted to run away. The police then gave chase, catching up with them at the Nellmapius off-ramp towards Pretoria. “All suspects have been arrested for conspiracy to commit business robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, including reckless and negligent driving,” Mngomezulu said. The suspects will appear in the Benoni Magistrate’s Court as soon as they are officially charged. -TNA Reporter
