In a statement, the WSAR said the search carried on on Monday evening but was disrupted by the windy weather. The search resumed on Tuesday morning and the womanâ€™s body was found on the mountain. Provincial police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said it is suspected that the 32-year-old woman fell while walking on the mountain.
