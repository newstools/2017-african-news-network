THE Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), which measures literacy rates of Grade 4 pupils, has revealed that an astounding 78% of these pupils are not able to read in any language. The Department of Basic Education yesterday welcomed the findings of the PIRLS 2016 report. “This report provides us with the opportunity to look deeper and try to pinpoint what some of the pertinent issues are, that as South Africa we struggle with. Now, more than ever, we need to think holistically about the development of children, and ensure the limited resources we have are effectively allocated and spent in the interests of future generations of South Africans. “In this pursuit, PIRLS 2016 offers an incredible data source to the sector,” the department’s spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga said. The report shows there has been a statistically significant improvement among Grade 4s in five African languages – Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Venda, and Tsonga. The department said its initiatives on uplifting girl pupils had certainly worked as scores of them do better than boys with each test cycle and the gap is widening. “The national spelling bee championship, which targets pupils in grades 4 to 6 (the intermediate phase) is aimed at improving pupils’ performance in languages, especially English,” Mhlanga said. Mhlanga said one of the glaring challenges that is found in the report is that as South Africans we are not a reading nation The report says that in other countries parents and children read recreationally far more extensively than South Africans. -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE|shonisanit@thenewage.co.za
