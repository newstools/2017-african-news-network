ANC Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe has emphasised the need for unity within the organisation as the national elective conference draws ever closer. Speaking at the ANC North West Provincial General Council (PGC) in Moretele, Mantashe’s choice of words has a striking resonance with events unfolding in another part of the country. ANC members in the Mpumalanga PGC overwhelmingly nominated an unknown candidate called “Unity” to lead the ANC with 223. However, the electoral commission declared the unity votes as abstentions which lead to Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma emerging as the preferred presidential candidate with 123 votes ahead of ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s 117. “Unity is not something artificial. It’s not like taking a syrup mixing it with water and calling it unity. Unity is about appreciating that if you disagree about a preferred candidate, you are not enemies,” said Mantashe. He also added that unity meant that members of the party who disagree with each other ought to constantly engage with one another, despite their differences. Meanwhile, in Mpumalanga, provincial chairperson David Mabuza emerged as the preferred candidate for the deputy president position while former KwaZulu-Natal premier Senzo Mchunu was nominated for secretary general. Gwede Mantashe was nominated for chairperson. Yesterday Cyril Ramaphosa overwhelming won the support of the Eastern Cape province. Ramaphosa secured 423 branch nominations at the party’s provincial general council in East London yesterday, while his rival Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma managed 61. On Tuesday the ANC Free State nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for ANC president. However, the party was ordered by the Free State High Court to re-run 29 branch general meetings before going to the provincial elective conference, which was set to take place from today. The party has moved the conference to next weekend, just a week before the national elective conference takes place.  -TNA Reporter
