The South African Maritime Safety Authority’s Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) rescued 22 crew members earlier today after their fishing boat encountered rough seas about 70km South West of Danger Point of the Cape South Coast, in Cape Town. MRCC Chief Jared Blows said after the crew was rescued the fishing vessel Ellis S sunk. “The vessel took in water after wrestling with the waves of approximately three to four meters in height and wind blowing at around 30km per hour,” Blows said. Blows said after MCRR received a distress signal they acted quickly to rescue the crew. “MCRR also used the Automatic Identification System installed at the centre to quickly identify which vessel it was and make contact with vessels which were close to the scene,” he said. Vessels that were identified closest to the scene were advised to change to the location where they will get help. All crew members were brought to safety, including those who were in other ships nearby. South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) will conduct further investigations to identify the causes of the vessel flooding and eventually flooding.
