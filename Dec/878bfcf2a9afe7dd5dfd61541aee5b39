The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) has warned the ANC and the government against changing the ownership structure of the bank. In a statement issued by the bank, it has warned that the changing of the structure of the bank at this time could raise the level of risk and uncertainty for the country in both financial and economic policy. The bank was responding to an announcement that the ANC at its 54th National Elective Conference decided that the Reserve Bank be nationalised. The bank said its private shareholder had no control or influence on its functioning. “The Sarb functions in the public interest, private shareholders have no influence whatsoever on monetary policy, financial stability, or banking regulation. “Policy making and execution is the preserve of the governor and the deputy governor, who are appointed by the president,” Sarb said. The bank said the rights of private shareholders in the bank are highly regulated. Nationalising the Sarb would also be expensive as its shares currently trade for much less than the price at which some existing shareholders are willing to sell theirs. “The ‘buying-out’ of existing shareholders will result in paying large sums of money to effect cosmetic changes that will have no bearing on the manner in which the Sarb carries out its mandate or executes its policy responsibilities.” -TNA Reporter
