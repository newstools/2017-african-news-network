Former KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson and premier Senzo Mchunu’s spokesperson Sthembiso Mshengu has denied claims that Mchunu has approached the court seeking to resolve the issue of 68 votes unaccounted for during the ANC’s top six election process. Mshengu was speaking after Dexter Selepe, co-owner of Selepe Seleke Attorneys announced that they were delivering a letter of demand to the steering committee about the 68 unaccounted ballot papers. Mshengu denied claims Mchunu is taking the ruling party to court. “Senzo Mchunu has not appointed any advocate to approach any court on this matter,” Mshengu said. He said Mchunu had no intention to approach any court to deal with the matter and that he would exhaust all avenues within the ANC. Mchunu was in a battle to be the ANC’s secretary general with Ace Magashule. Magashule won with 2 360 votes to Mchunu’s 2 336. The number of voting delegates was 4776. There were eight abstentions and four spoiled votes, bringing the total number to 4 708. Mchunu lost to Magashule by 24 votes. His supporters have been asking what happened to 68 votes not included in the total tally. -TNA Reporter
