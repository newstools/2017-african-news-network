Seven suspects alleged to be Glebelands Hostel hitmen are expected to appear in Umlazi Magistrate court in KwaZulu-Natal. The suspects were arrested on different occasions and are suspected to be linked to a string of murders at the hostel. The latest suspect was arrested on Saturday following an intelligence-driven operation led by the police in the province.  A 29-year-old suspect who was the last to be apprehended is facing a charge of attempted murder.  It is alleged that he had previously evaded arrest, however, information led to his arrest.   Meanwhile, the other five suspect were remanded in custody last week after appearing in court on Friday.  Bhekukwazi Mdweshu, Vukani Mcobothi, Khayelihle Mbuthuma, Wonderboy Hlophe, and Matlala Ntshangase will also appear in court on Monday. Another suspect also appeared in court separately for a suspected murder in the area.  Police in KZN have vowed to clear the area of criminals for a safe festive season for residents. “We want criminals to know that they will not enjoy a peaceful festive season as long they are on the run from police,” Provincial Major General Bheki Langa said.  -TNA Reporter
