Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was impressed with his side following their 1-0 win over stubborn Maritzburg United on Wednesday evening at the Loftus Stadium. The win sees the the Brazilians extend their lead at the top of the Absa Premiership table to five points with two games in hand. Sundowns have 25 points after playing 12 games, leading 2nd place, Orlando Pirates by five points. Mosimane couldn’t hide his excitement and praised the goal scorer Percy Tau for his sterling performance which earned him a man of the match award. “We have the experience. We survived. I am so happy for Percy for the goal he scored. We have been speaking about it for him to go to his left all the time. “I was so excited when he scored. But it was a difficult game, it needed experience. It was a big win for us. This was a big game,” said Mosimane. The team of Choice was coming to this encounter brimming with confidence following their 3-0 win over Baroka FC on Friday. This performance made Mosimane to be aware of the threat the Pietermaritzburg based outfit could pose on them. “That’s their style (attacking) and are good at it and they will hurt people especially when they play away. They have a unique way of putting three attackers, one up and… I don’t know how to explain it but when you do match analysis you see the way they play it, it is very difficult. “I am so happy that we dealt with the set pieces because they are gladiators and you saw I had to put Wayne and Anele. However, the Sundowns coach also heaped praise on his counterpart coach Fadlu Davids for giving them a run for their money. “Maritzburg is a very good team. I think Fadlu Davids is doing exceptionally well. We were sweating, we survived. We had to put defenders to rub the results. They have the speed,” concluded Mosimane. -Ntsako Mashaba
