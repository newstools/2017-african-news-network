The year 2017 has been an interesting one for South Africans. We laughed, cried, lost loved ones and welcomed some. As we walk down memory lane today, we cannot cross over to into 2018 without highlighting some of the very significant campaigns that got South Africans talking. Here are five campaigns that made our dinner table conversations, social media debates but most importantly, allowed the public to stand and voice their struggles and opinions. 1. #DataMustFall Last year, Touch Central CEO Tbo Touch and Cliff Central founder Gareth Cliff addressed Parliament’s telecommunications and postal services portfolio committee about their concerns over high data costs in South Africa as opposed to neighbouring countries. Thousands of South Africans took to Twitter to support the #DataMustFall campaign. Twitter users also called for a social media blackout, to protest against the high cost of data. 2. #ZumaMustFall South Africans all over the country gathered in protest for President Jacob Zuma to step down as president of the ANC and South Africa. While some gathered on their small suburban street corners, others littered city centres calling for Zuma to go. 3. #MeToo In an attempt to break the culture of silence around sexual abuse, South African women joined the international #MeToo campaign, sharing their personal stories of sexual assault and harassment. The campaign began as a response to allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. 4. #MenAreTrash Following the sad news of Karabo Mokoena, who was allegedly killed by her boyfriend earlier this year, women took to social media to express their exhaustion over abuse and the killing of women. This gave rise to the campaign, allowing women to share their stories using the hashtag #MenAreTrash. 5. #RhodesWar A few weeks ago, two student activists were expelled for life from Rhodes University for their involvement in a protest against rape culture. Students gathered in protest to express their dissatisfaction with the university while some took to Twitter with cries, admonishing sexual abuse on campus. -TNA Reporter
