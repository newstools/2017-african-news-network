The police in Limpopo have launched a manhunt for two women who allegedly sexually molested a man in Tzaneen on Saturday. It’s understood a 25-year old man hitchhiking from Polokwane to Tzaneen was given a lift by two women who were travelling in a Toyota Tazz. Provincial police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the women drove to a secluded area where they molested the man. “They drove into the bushes in Magoebaskloof where they pointed firearms at him, forced him to drink a certain substance and subsequently took turns raping him,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said that after the assault, the women drove with the man in their car before leaving him in a secluded area near the Tzaneen CBD. The man has been admitted to hospital for treatment. “The victim then went to the police where he reported the case.” Ngoepe has urged members of the community to use reliable transport or public transport at all times, to prevent these kind incidents from happening. “Both motorists and pedestrians who use these hiking spots often become exposed to crimes like carjackings, murders, rapes and armed robberies.” Anyone with information can contact Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Machimani on 082 451 7181, Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. -TNA Reporter
