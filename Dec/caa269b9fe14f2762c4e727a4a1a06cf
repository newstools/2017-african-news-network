Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has on Thursday commended the work of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in KwaZulu-Natal for arresting a suspect in the murders at the Glebelands Hostels. This comes after the arrest of Mondli Mthethwa who is suspected to be linked to two murders at Glebelands as well as other murder cases in the Bhekithemba area. SAPS’ Vuyo Mhaga said, “SAPS members tracked down the man and during the search, they found Mthethwa in possession of an unlicensed 9mm pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition”. Mthethwa appeared at Umlazi Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday following his arrest. Mbalula thanked the people of Umlazi for their continued support of the efforts made by SAPS in bringing about safety at their community. -TNA Reporter
