As the country observes 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children, acting Limpopo police commissioner Major-General Bafana Linda has condemned the escalating trend of domestic violence in the province. This after two separate incidents, in the Waterval policing area outside Makhado and the Hoedspruit policing area outside Phalaborwa. In Hoedspruit, a 35-year-old man was arrested for raping his five-year old daughter. The man and his wife are reportedly separated and have joint custody of their son and daughter. A statement released by the police said it was the suspect’s turn to spend time with the kids and upon their return to their mother’s home, the children informed her that the daughter has been raped. In Waterval, a 31-year-old man was arrested on charges of murder and attempted murder.   The suspect allegedly had a domestic dispute with his wife and stabbed her and their children, aged two and five, several times. The five-year-old child died in hospital. The suspect, who is on parole from a 15-year murder sentence, was arrested on Monday. The police are still investigating both cases and members of the community have been advised to resolve their domestic disputes amicably by seeking intervention of the relevant authorities rather than killing each other. -TNA Reporter
