Suspended Eskom Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Anoj Singh received a severe tongue lashing from the chairperson of the portfolio committee on public enterprises in Parliament today for not supplying the inquiry into state capture at Eskom with documents. Singh appeared before the committee to answer questions related to the role he played as CFO. Singh was previously fingered by some witnesses who appeared before the inquiry as a culprit on many financial irregularities at the power utility. Committee chairperson Zukiswa Rantho told the commission that Singh had only supplied the commission with a 400-page bundle on Monday night. “I want to register our disappointment with you,” Rantho said. She told Singh that he was given six months to prepare documents that would help the inquiry do its work. “You seem to have undermined the work of Parliament.” She told Singh that he would be given another date where he would have to appear with all relevant documents. -TNA Reporter
