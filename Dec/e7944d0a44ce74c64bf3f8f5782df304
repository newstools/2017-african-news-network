The South African Police Service (Saps) in Limpopo has condemned continuous attacks on the elderly in a number of areas in the province. This follows the arrest of a 26-year-old man for the alleged killing of a 75-year-old woman in the Mphephu policing area, outside Thohoyandou, earlier this week. The police, in a statement, said the deceased, Elsie Makhokha, was last seen seated under the lapa outside her home with her grandson. It’s understood that as she went inside, her grandson followed her and closed the door. Neighbours later saw smoke coming out of the woman’s home. They rushed to the house, broke the window and pulled her out but Makhokha was declared dead by Emergency Service members upon their arrival. The suspect, who is the deceased’s grandson, was caught and arrested as he attempted to run away. The police said he would appear in court as soon as he was officially charged. Investigations are still underway. -TNA Reporter
