The City of Johannesburg’s Group Forensic and Investigations Services is investigating a case of attempted burglary at Ennerdale Clinic after criminals tried to gain entry into the health facility over the weekend. This comes just a few weeks after a computer and a blood pressure machine were stolen at the same clinic. MMC for health and social development Dr Mpho Phalatse has called on the community to assist in securing the facility. “It is important that we work together to secure our facilities. We cannot allow acts of criminality to compromise the quality of service to our people. I have reported the attempted break-in to our Group Forensic and Investigations unit under the general Shadrack Sibiya to assist my department in apprehending those involved,” said Phalatse. Phalatse also stated it is still a concern that health facilities are being targeted by criminals. -TNA Reporter
