Three suspects are due to appear at the Cape Town Magistrate’s court on Friday to face charges of human trafficking. Pretty Hlengiwe Mkhize (33), Uche Davidson (41) and Aishatu Musae (34) were arrested by the Hawks on Thursday. They all remained in custody after their case was postponed last week for further investigation. Provincial police spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said a woman was lured to Cape Town with promises of a job. “A 26-year-old victim was allegedly lured by a lady known to her with promises of employment.” “On arrival, she was allegedly picked up by two men who subsequently kept her against her will and allegedly turned into a sex-worker.” The victim’s ID book and cellphone were allegedly confiscated by the suspects. Ramovha added that the victim managed to escape and reported the case to the Hawks which led to their subsequent arrest. -TNA Reporter
