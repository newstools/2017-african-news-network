The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has assured beneficiaries that all Sassa offices will remain open during December and will only close, as usual, on public holidays like Christmas, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. This comes after false information circulated claiming that Sassa offices would be closed during December and that beneficiaries would not receive their January payments. “Social grant payments for December are currently being made and the process will continue until 15 December at Sassa pay points,” the agency said in a statement. It said beneficiaries who used ATMs and shops to withdraw their grants could do so until 22 December. Acting Sassa CEO Pearl Bhengu said: “All social grant recipients should remain vigilant at this time of the year and never disclose their card details to anyone, including their pin and ID numbers. I also want to take this opportunity to wish all beneficiaries of social grants a safe and happy festive season.” “We urge our beneficiaries to report such acts of criminality to the police so that these scammers can be put behind bars.” Sassa also indicated that, from January 2018, social grant payments would be paid as usual from the first day of every month. -TNA Reporter
