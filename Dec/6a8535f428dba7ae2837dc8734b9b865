The Free State ANC elective conference that is supposed to be taking place in Parys was for most of Monday delayed after disgruntled members of the party filed yet another court application to stop it. Court papers were filed early on Monday in the Free State High Court, Bloemfontein. The applicants wanted to have the conference nullified because there are branches who did not the adhere to a court order. However, provincial spokesperson, Thabo Meeko said they are not aware of the court proceedings taking place. “Our objective is to have the conference proceed and elect new leadership later today.” Meeko also denied that there are some other branches who are boycotting the conference. “People who took us to court, we seek to create space to engage them. At this point we are dealing and adopting credentials, to know who is here and who is not.” He said they don’t foresee where credentials will indicate that delegates are boycotting the conference. “As far as we are concerned all delegates who are supposed to be here are indeed here.” He added that on the issue boycotting. “We can’t speak on that. As matter of fact as far as we know no one is boycotting”. Meeko added that at the time of going to the conference provincial secretary has not received any apology from deputy chairman Thabo Manyoni not to attend the conference. When addressing why Manyoni snubbed the conference Meeko said. “I can confirm that Manyoni is aware that’s provincial congress is going ahead. As to why he is not here is everyone’s guess.” He also refuted claims that a warrant of arrest is to be issued for Premier Ace Magashule for a defying court order. The conference is scheduled to resume later today. Watch the full media briefing below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl1jP1a7-4w   -Michael Tlhakudi
