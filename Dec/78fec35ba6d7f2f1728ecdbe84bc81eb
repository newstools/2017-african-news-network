The Van Reenen’s pass has been reopened after two multi-vehicle accidents on Friday morning. It is reported that two multi-vehicle crashes at Van Reenen, between Harrismith and Ladysmith, caused the road closure and three people, including a 6-month-old baby were killed in the accidents. KZN EMS spokesperson Robert Mckenzie said: “In the first crash, two people were killed when three trucks, three minibus taxis and a car collided near the Caltex petrol station. “In the second crash, which happened at least two kilometres from the first scene, one person was killed after two trucks collided.” Authorities have appealed motorists for being patient as the backlogs were being cleared. -TNA Reporter
