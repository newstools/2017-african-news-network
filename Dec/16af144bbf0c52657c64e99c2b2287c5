Following a hard late-night slog which went well into the night, on the ground reports claim that credentials have finally been adopted at the ANC National Conference. Last night conference proceeding including the crucial nomination process was delayed as the party struggled to clean up the credentials process. Yesterday following outgoing President Jacob Zuma’s political report, deputy general secretary Jessie Duarte had confirmed that credentials had yet to be finalised. Unconfirmed allegations of bogus credentials and ‘ghost delegates’ have also surfaced during the conference. With the credentials finally being adopted, the crucial nomination processes and voting are likely to get underway in earnest. Below is a break-down of how the delegate numbers finally look.
