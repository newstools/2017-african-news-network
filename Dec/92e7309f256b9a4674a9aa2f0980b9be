A TOTAL of 145 branch representatives will leave the Western Cape by bus today, armed with instructions to stay true to their mandate to vote for Cyril Ramaphosa in the ANC leadership elections. The contingent, the Western Cape ANC secretary Faiez Jacobs said, has been urged to resist any attempts to be induced by bribes not to vote for Ramaphosa, who has the support of 121 branches in the province to succeed Jacob Zuma as ANC president. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Ramaphosa’s main rival for the ANC leadership mantle, has managed to garner the backing of 13 branches. He was aware of speculation that bribes could be used to swing delegates, not only from there, but from other provinces as well. However, the Western Cape has prepared its delegates for such an event, Jacobs said. “They have been told that the mandate of the branches is sacrosanct and that they must honour this obligation,” Jacobs said. Our vote and morals are not for sale. We will not go into deals. We have asked delegates to remain sober, focused and maintain discipline and high morals.” dennisc@thenewage.co.za -Refilwe Magashule
