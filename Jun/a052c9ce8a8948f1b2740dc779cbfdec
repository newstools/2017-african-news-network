The MK Veterans National Council steering committee has described last week&#8217;s MK Veterans Association (MKMVA) elective conference as a gathering of a group of people wanting to perpetuate corruption in the name of Umkhonto weSizwe.Last week the MKMVA conference in Boksburg elected Kebby Maphatsoe as president with Des van Rooyen assuming the role of treasurer-general.But today the MK Council steering committee poured water over the election, describing the conference as a sham.&#8220;This so-called conference was convened in violation of, among others, some of the basic constitutional requirements governing MKMVA conferences, which Mr Maphatsoe claims to champion,&#8221;a statement said.The steering committee says it has since begun its own preparations for a &#8220;legitimate&#8221; MK conference which will be held at the end of August.The steering committee says it will work alongside MKMVA office bearers who have distanced themselves from last week&#8217;s conference.A group comprising, among others, MKMVA deputy chairperson Teenage Monama; general secretary, Dumisani Ntuli; and deputy general secretary, Tshidiso Paka, all described the conference as fraudulent . They alleged that more than 700 delegates registered to attend were not bonafide MK military veterans.&#8220;We believe that the stance taken by the majority of MKMVA officials who publicly disassociated themselves from participating in the conference ,will go a long way in providing leadership in an environment which cries out for more vision and integrity,&#8221; said the steering committee.The steering committee said it will consult with the office of the Secretary General of the ANC, Gwede Mantashe towards preparing for its own conference.The rift between the rival MK factions has gradually escalated with both groups claiming to be the legitimate representative of war veterans.Last week the MKMVA&#8217;s Des van Rooyen said the council had no standing in the ANC, declaring that &#8220;the council is not a structure. This is just a group of members who are disgruntled&#8221;.Related: MK factional war intensifiesRelated: Nyanda led MK Council snubs policy conference-TNA Reporter
