The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa)today welcomed efforts by the police to resolve the murder of Thembisile Yende with the arrest of a suspect who appeared in court yesterday.David Ngwenya, 43, appeared at the Springs Magistrate s Court on Monday charged with the premeditated murder of Yende.Ngwenya was arrested last Thursday in Carletonville, west of Johannesburg.Police spokesperson Johannes Ramphora could not confirm that the accused was an Eskom employee as previously reported. We suspect that the guy might be a hitman who was hired, but we are not sure about that as investigations are ongoing and we are still looking for other people involved in the murder, Ramphora said.Yende s decomposing body was discovered last month locked inside one of the Eskom substation offices in Springs in Ekurhuleni. She had been reported missing for several days before her body was found.Postmortem results showed that Yende had sustained head injuries and bruises on her neck before she died.&#8220;As Numsa we hope that this latest development will be the first step in helping the Yende family to achieve a sense of justice over her murder. We hope that the investigation will result in a successful prosecution of the alleged perpetrator and that the courts will hand down a stiff sentence for this heinous crime,&#8221; Numsa National spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi.&#8220;We will continue to keep up the pressure on Eskom to improve safety conditions for our members particularly those who are forced to work in isolated places.&#8221;-TNA Reporter
