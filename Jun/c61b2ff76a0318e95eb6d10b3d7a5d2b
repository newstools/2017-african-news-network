The DA says it will criminal charges against Cabinet Ministers and Heads of State Owned Enterprises it believes have been captured by the Gupta Family.The list includes former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, Public Enterprises Lynne Brown, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen, head of Denel Dan Mantsha and former Chief of State Protocol Bruce Koloane.&#8220;The DA will proceed to lay criminal charges against these Ministers and officials. We will soon announce the details of the charge laying,&#8221; said DA Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen.Last week The DA opened a criminal case against Deputy Finance Minister, Sfiso Buthelezi, following allegations that he benefited from R150-million in contracts from the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) awarded to his brother, while he was Chairperson of its board.Meanwhile, the DA says it hopes that multi-party consensus can be reached on the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on state capture.The DA wants the committee to investigate evidence of undue influence by certain individuals over the exercise of executive authority in South Africa.&#8220;It has become clear that a sweeping investigation into state capture is required and Parliament, empowered by Section 55 of the Constitution to oversee the exercise of executive authority, is best placed to undertake it,&#8221; Steenhuisen said.The DA has urged all political parties to support its motion saying they should get behind its establishment in order to hold the executive accountable including ministers in the cabinet who have been corrupted.Meanwhile, Steenhuisen said he finds it staggering that the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is &#8220;missing in action&#8221; adding that National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams should be investigating claims made in various media.&#8220;The defending silence of the Public Protector and Shaun Abrahams brings concerns whether the two have not been captured yet, he said.The charges relate to a series of emails which were leaked to the media which purport to provide proof of widescale state capture by members of the Gupta family.The President has taken the Public Protector s report on review saying it interfered with the Presidential prerogative to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry. This will be heard in September.-TNA Reporter
