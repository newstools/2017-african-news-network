The South Gauteng High court has on Monday ruled that section 18 of the Sexual Offences Act was inconsistent with the country&#8217;s Constitution.This means that sexual offences victims can get a prosecution on cases that are older than 20 years, however this judgment is still subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Court.The court earlier reserved its judgment on an application challenging the law that places a statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases that do not include penetration.This follows a high profile case against the deceased billionaire stockbroker Sydney Frankel. In that case, eight people who accused him of sexual molestation were precluded from instituting criminal charges against him due to the prescription laws .At the time of his death earlier this year, Frankel faced multiple cases of child molestation and sexual abuse.Frankel was accused of sexually abusing the &#8220;very young&#8221; complainants in the 1970s and 1980s.Non-government Organisation Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA) said it hoped for a positive judgment which would clear the way for the matter to be taken to the Constitutional Court. We further hope that the unconstitutionality of section 18 of the Sexual Offences Act is acknowledged and rubber stamped by the Constitutional Court as soon as possible so that it can be presented to Parliament, the organisation said.The organisation said it wanted the laws to be amended to accommodate all sexual abuse victims. The organisation said the law was constitutionally flawed.The law does not allow for victims of sexual abuse of any kind which occurred prior to 2007 to have their cases heard in court.If successful, the case will open the way for victims of sexual abuse to come forward and institute criminal charges against their perpetrators, regardless of when the abuse took place.-TNA Reporter
