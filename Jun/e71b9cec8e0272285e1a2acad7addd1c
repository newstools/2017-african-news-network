At least 13 officials will be served with contemplation letters of suspension following explicit pictures that appeared on social media at the weekend.This comes after pictures surfaced on Facebook of a seemingly raucous &#8220;family day&#8221; at the Johannesburg Correctional Centre (Sun City Prison), showing scantily-clad women dancing with prisoners.Acting National Correctional Services Commissioner James Smalberger briefed the media on Monday. He said the outcome of investigation will be made known on Friday.&#8220;The way in which the females appeared on social media is unacceptable and we can never tolerate a situation where female members of society appear like that in front of offenders,&#8221; Smalberger said.The department condemned what took place at the prison with the strongest contempt. He also stated that the pictures were taken during a youth month event which had various items.Smalberger said even if the permission was granted for the event, and the entertainment was approved, &#8220;that kind of entertainment&#8221; was never approved.&nbsp;
