It was a rampage really,&#8221; he said, adding that he also heard a shout of: &#8220;This is for Allah&#8221;.Britain is on high alert only 12 days after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert in Manchester, northwest England and ahead of Thursday&#8217;s general election, in which security is a major theme.It is the latest in a string of attacks to hit Europe, including in Paris, Berlin and Saint Petersburg.Facebook activated its safety check function for people in London to let their loved ones know they are safe and local residents offered accommodation for anyone left stranded by the attack, under the hashtag #sofaforlondon.Witnesses described the van speeding into several pedestrians on London Bridge and then the knife-wielding men sprinting towards bars packed with revellers enjoying a Saturday night out.Several people said they were ordered to stay inside pubs and restaurants by police and eventually had to come out with their hands on their heads.Italian photographer Gabriele Sciotto, who was watching the football at the Wheatsheaf pub in Borough Market, said he saw three men shot just outside the pub.In his picture, a man wearing combat trousers, with a shaved head and what looked like a belt with canisters attached to it could be seen on the ground with two more bodies behind him.&#8220;In two or five seconds, they shot all the three men down,&#8221; Sciotto told the BBC.Police said the three men were shot by a police armed response team within eight minutes of receiving the first call at 10:08 pm (2108 GMT).Dozens of emergency vehicles could be seen and a wide area around London Bridge was cordoned off as two helicopters hovered overhead.
