Gauteng MEC of health Dr Gwen Ramokgoba has on Monday tendered her apology to the families affected by the ongoing forensic pathology assistants strike in Gauteng.The strike, which has lasted for more than a week, has left bodies piling up in mortuaries in the province as the assistants intensify their protest action. The DA in the province has now called for a legal action against the workers, claiming the action was illegal.&#8220;I want to send my apology, my regret and condolences to all of the families affected by the action by forensic pathology officers. I know that this is an inconvenience and it does not make the pain any easier, Ramokgoba said.Meanwhile, national spokesperson for Nehawu Khaya Xaba rejected the call by the DA in Gauteng that demanded an urgent court order be brought against the workers. Xaba said the workers had not been participating in a protest or strike action. There is no strike here. It is just the workers refusing to do work that they are not supposed to be doing in the first place, work that they are not remunerated for, he saidXaba said that the workers had been reporting for work and doing all duties prescribed in their job description.&#8220;The only work that they have not been doing is work that is out of their scope, he saidXaba claimed that the assistants had previously been performing duties they were not qualified for.&#8220;If we are doing the work and the organisation benefits from it, why are we not remunerated for it? Why are you not taking us for training so that we can register with a relevant body and get a qualification so that we can legally do the work? Ramakgoba has acknowledges the concerns expressed by the workers.&#8220;My understanding is that the work that the officers are doing is the work that they have been doing while they were with the South African Police Service and they continue doing it with the health department,&#8221; Ramokgoba said.She said the department extended its gratitude to the military personnel for their intervention.&#8220;The military personnel assisted significantly,&#8221; she said, also applauding the doctors who have worked throughput the weekend to reduce the backlog.-TNA Reporter
