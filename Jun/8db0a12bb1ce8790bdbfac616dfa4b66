As hopes of finding 23-year-old teacher Philile Gumede alive continue to fade police are hopeful that her boyfriend s court appearance this week will lead to some progress in the investigation.Gumede disappeared on April 22 after her boyfriend Edwin Steynberg picked her up after her honours graduation ceremony at Tshwane University of Technology.Soshanguve police spokesperson Const Zanele Mtshweni said that investigations were ongoing as they had no leads.She said that the boyfriend Steynberg was last seen with Gumede and he alleged that he dropped her off at Soshanguve Crossing Mall. But when the footage was extracted and viewed we couldn t see her, so he lied and was charged with perjury. He appeared in court at the beginning of June and will appear again on June 29 in Soshanguve Magistrate s Court, she said.Mtshweni said that they did not have any information that linked Steynberg to Philile s disappearance as police raided his home in Rietfontein but found nothing incriminating.She said the family was not doing well since her disappearance and Gumede s brother came to the police station every day to check if they had found anything.Meanwhile 30 femicide cases have been reported to police since January. Every week there are reports ofgruesome killings of women and children, either by their intimate partners or strangers.According to Missing Children SA (MCSA) young women contributed a lot to the number of missing persons.National case officer at MCSA Bianca van Aswegen said the number of cases reported increased every year with 485 people missing from May last year to April.Figures are based on cases only reported to them and do not reflect all the cases reported to the police, she said. Out of the reported number, teenagers between ages of 13-17 years contribute 72% to the rising number.In 2013, 1697 cases of missing children were reported to the police. Our case load increases every year not necessarily only because more individuals go missing, but also because more people become aware of Missing Children SA, Aswegen said.She said that in the space of one year they had managed to find a total of 312 people out of the reported number. The sad part is 73 people including children were found deceased, she said.DIKELEDI RAMABOPAnews@thenewage.co.za
