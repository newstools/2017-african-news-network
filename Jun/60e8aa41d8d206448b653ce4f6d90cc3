Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini has warned its affiliates of an intense political battle ahead of the ANC&#8217;s elective conference which he says will have many casualties.Dlamini told delegates during the final day of Cosatu&#8217;s Central Committee meeting that following its Central Executive Council (CEC) last year where it resolved to endorse Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Jacob Zuma as ANC President, a disemboweled dead cat, with no head had been left on his door step.&#8221; I understand exactly why and what that message means. Tomorrow it wont be a cat it will be a human being,&#8221;&#8221; If you want us to go on this journey understand that there will be those casualties. This is a political battle we have taken,&#8221; said Dlamini.Dlamini also issued a challenge to the trade federations delegates to muster support for its preferred candidate.&#8221; On behalf of this leadership, I want to be called into programmes on the ground led by yourselves addressing workers. I want to see you in branches of the ANC persuading them that we have a preferred candidate, Cyril Ramaphosa,&#8221; he said.Dlamini said this will determine whether Cosatu has the capacity to influence the outcome of the ANC&#8217;s elective conference.-TNA Reporter
