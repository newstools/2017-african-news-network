Presiding judge Dayalin Chetty in the Jayed Panayiotou murder trial today(Monday) accepted cell-phone records to be used as evidence against two of the accused at the Port Elizabeth High Court. This is despite Panayiotou’s counsel argument that the court should not to use the recordings, Chetty had allowed the state to continue with the cellphone evidence. Panayiotou’s lawyers had argued that the details of his client’s cellphone amounted to an invasion of privacy, also arguing that the state had obtained the cell phone evidence also unlawfully. Last week the court watched the secret recording video footage which revealed evidence that implicated Panayiotou’s involvement in the killing of his wife. The video clip highlighted snippets that showed a meeting between the alleged middleman, Luthando Siyoni and Panayiotou, discussing the details of the planned murder. In the video, Panayiotou, among others, cautioned Siyoni about how they communicated “because the investigators are listening to his calls”. Panayiotou and his co-accused Zolani Sibeko and Sinethemba Nenembe have been charged with conspiring to kidnap and murder school teacher Jayde Panayiotou in April 2015. -TNA Reporter
