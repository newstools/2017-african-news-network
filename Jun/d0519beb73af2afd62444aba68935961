South Africa will mark the UN s annual International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking today at a time when the use of drugs is growing in the country and worldwide.The UN General Assembly observes this day as an expression of its determination to strengthen action and cooperation to achieve the goal of an international society free of drug abuse.According to the Health System Trust, while no official figures exist for drug use in South Africa, cannabis and mandrax are seen as the most commonly used illicit drugs. South Africa accounts for the second largest quantity of cannabis seized anywhere in the world. It is surpassed only by Mexico. Estimates vary but it is believed that between 70-80% of the world s consumption of mandrax (methaqualone) occurs within South Africa s borders, the organisation said.The South African Medical Research Council s chief specialist scientist in its alcohol and drug abuse unit, Bronwyn Meyers, said that 11% of the South African population (5.7 million people) would suffer from an addiction disorder in their lifetime.Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Manyathula-Khoza warned of the high increase in drug usage among the youth in South Africa.She said there had been an increase of 88% of drug users, particular young males under the age of 20, following the Western Cape and Northern Cape with 98% and 92% respectively. In KwaZulu-Natal, drug use is at 88%, in the North West at 82% and Free State, 74%. The use of nyaope continues to pose a problem, with 4% of patients in Gauteng admitting to the use of nyaope, Manyathula-Khoza explained.Nyaope, also known as whoonga, is a lethal mixture of dagga, heroin, antiretroviral drugs, rat poison and acid. It s a uniquely South African street drug that is highly deadly and addictive.According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the recently released World Drug Report 2017 examines another worrying phenomenon, the nexus between drugs, crime and terrorism, and reveals a shifting pattern of relationships.In Gauteng, the day will be commemorated in Mabopane, north of Tshwane, by Manyathula-Khoza to encourage rehabilitated drug users to stay clean.The area was recently in the spotlight after the discovery of the so-called Bluetooth phenomenon in which users inject themselves with the blood of another person already on a high.According to the department of social development, a few former drug addicts will share their success stories to encourage others and stay drug free.The event will take place at the Mabopane Indoors Centre in Morula View.KUTULLO MADISHAkutullom@thenewage.co.za
