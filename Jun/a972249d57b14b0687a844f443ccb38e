The Gauteng department of roads and transport has invested more than R33m towards the restoration of Tolwane Bridge in Mabopane, north of Pretoria.The bridge, which serves as an important link between communities as it crosses over the Tolwane River, was washed away during heavy floods in 2014.As a result of the damage, local commuters and operators have had to take a detour while travelling to neighbouring communities.Detailed design investigations by the department revealed that the existing bridge structure did not have sufficient capacity to handle floods, necessitating construction of a new bridge structure.Due to the required size of a new bridge to enable the accommodation of the design floods, the road will be raised by about 2m. The project s scope will include the reconstruction of a new two lane, single carriageway, surfaced, rural road. Furthermore, the reconstructed structure will entail upgrading of the storm-water drainage system. These new upgrades will take into account designs that accommodate 20-year flooding for minor structures and 50-year flood recurrence formajor structures, MEC Ismail Vadi said.Additional upgrades include the reinstatement of the D603 road to negate the current impassibility of the road, upgrading the road to single carriageway surfaced road within appropriate road reserve widths, integration of the new road with the existing infrastructure and improvement of road user safety through above measures among others.The project is expected to be completed in the next 12 months.Meanwhile, the Johannesburg Roads Agency has embarked upon upgrades on Harrison Street and Queen Elizabeth bridges in the inner city of Johannesburg.The two bridges form part of the city s arterial transportation network and are located in Braamfontein, north of the Johannesburg CBD.The agency said both bridges are ageing and deteriorating and require urgent repairs and rehabilitation. The repairs are therefore required to safeguard all road users. A traffic accommodation plan is in place and will be active until the end of June. Temporary road warning signs and barricades have been installed. Pedestrian movement will not be affected as access is accommodated on Cork Avenue, the agency said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@@thenewage.co.za
