Activist group Black First Land First (BLF) has fired its &#8220;warning shot&#8221; to Absa Bank, calling on it to &#8220;pay back the money&#8221; as directed by the public protector or to face a national shut down of its branches.Today BLF members held pickets outside various Absa branches in Gauteng, demanding that the institution carry out what the public demanded of them.&#8220;We are not shutting down yet. We are going to have a national shut down of Absa. We are giving them five days to change their minds,&#8221;BLF leader Andile Mngxitama said.Mngxitama and his organisation have called on the bank to abide by Busisiwe Mkhwebane&#8217;s finding, recommending that Absa pay R1.125bn. Her investigation found that the bank had unduly benefited from an apartheid era bailout.He said his organisation had written to Absa&#8217;s chief executive Maria Ramos demanding that they pay back the money without delay or face a shut down.&#8220;Maria Ramos the corrupt, racist, wife of Trevor Manuel must change her mind. If she does not change her mind, BLF will mobilise society and we will shut down Absa. Absa is our bank because it was formed from the money stolen from us,&#8221; Mngxitama said.Absa has denied any wrong doing . It has announced it would take the report on review to have it set aside.Absa spokesperson Songezo Zibi said the public protector report was based on inaccuracies, and was irrationally conceived.Yesterday the Reserve Bank filed court papers with the North Gauteng High Court to also set aside the remedial action proposed by Mkhwebane.The bank said in its papers the remedial action suggested by Mkhwebane fell &#8220;outside her powers&#8221; and was unlawful.Mkhwebane had ordered Parliament to look into changing the Constitution so it could change the remit of the bank.-TNA Reporter
