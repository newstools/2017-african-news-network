As the registration process at University of Witwatersrand (Wits) is currently underway on Monday, the university has noted that some students are unable to register due to a lack of financial resources.&#8220;Wits has thus made several concessions to enable the majority of academically talented students to register at the University, whilst ensuring that the university remains sustainable,&#8221; Wits said in a statement.The concessions comes after consultations with the Department of Higher Education and Training and other stakeholders with regards to historical debts of students. WITS SRC indicated in a statement that the university is approaching a financial deficit of R56 million, and they cannot afford to cost incur the cost of historical debts which amount to R400 million (including last year&#8217;s).The department and other stakeholders reached a couple of agreements with regards to registrations and historical debts.Amongst the agreements between stakeholders, it was agreed that the department will cover the fee increase of 8% (gap funding) for 2017 for students whose combined family income is below R600 000 per annum. This includes both students on NSFAS and missing middle students.&#8220;The Department will pay for all students who have qualified for NSFAS, including those with historical debt. Students on NSFAS may register without making the first fee payment in January 2017,&#8221; said the statement.Furthermore, the department indicated that the missing middle students are responsible for their own historical debt.&#8220;Students in the missing middle with historical debt who owe R10 000 or less will have their debt automatically rolled into their 2017 fees and will be allowed to register.&#8221; Students who owe more than R10 000 are requested to pay half the outstanding balance and enter into a payment plan for the remainder of the funds, before being allowed to register.&#8221;In 2016, Wits administered about R1 billion in financial aid, scholarships and bursaries that assisted more than 22 000 students.&#8220;The University and the SRC are continuing to work to attract funding for bursaries, scholarships and financial aid,&#8221; added the university.Financing of the higher education system will be announced during the course of the year.-TNA Reporter
