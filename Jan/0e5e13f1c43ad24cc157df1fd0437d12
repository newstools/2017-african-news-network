Prophet Theo Bongani Maseko of the Breath of Christ Ministries in Daveyton on Wednesday said giving his congregants engine cleaner was one of many instructions he has received from God.Maseko, who gave his congregants engine cleaning fluid to drink in order to be healed, joins the ever growing list of controversial pastors who have in recent times used unconventional methods for healing.&#8220;We are a Christian church, we believe in God and our faith rests in God and not in anything else. Since we are born again and no longer born of a woman but of the spirit, now we carry the DNA of Jesus. We carry Jesus in us,&#8221; said Maseko.He said the reason behind giving his congregants the cleaning fluid is to deliver, heal them and to also reveal the power of God in his church.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t just buy it and make them drink it. I prayed for it first and I drank it several times myself and it tastes like honey,&#8221; he said.The fluid was offered to them during the two services he held on Tuesday. He said it healed five of the people who followed his instruction.Maseko posted pictures of the congregants consuming the fluid on the church&#8217;s Facebook page.Meanwhile acting CEO of The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Religious, Cultural and Linguistic Communities (CRL) Edward Mafadza said the commission is in the process of finalising a report, to be presented in Parliament, for religious leaders to be regulated and practicing pastors to be licensed.&#8220;The community and media sector are helping to contribute to the report and we are hoping that by March we will be able to present the report to Parliament,&#8221;said Mafadza.-Bianca Makondo
