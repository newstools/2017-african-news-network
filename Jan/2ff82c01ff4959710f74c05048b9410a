Parents of a pair of conjoined twins from Big Bend in Swaziland, who underwent a successful six-hour separation operation at Netcare Unitas Hospital in Centurion on Saturday, are happy that the operation went successful.The twin girls, Uwenzile and Uyihlelile Shilongonyane, who together weighed 4.21kg at birth, were born joined at the abdomen on January 2 to Bongekile Simelane,19, and her husband Mbongeni Sihlongonyane.Simelane said until the seventh month of her pregnancy she had no idea she was about to give birth to a second set of twins. At first I was not happy to hear that I was expecting twins for the second time. However, once they were born, everything changed. After their birth, I was at first not worried as I thought the babies were only attached at the umbilical cord, she said.The young couple praised Portia Mabuela, an enrolled nurse at Netcare Unitas Hospital, who had become close to the family.Even though she was off duty, Portia came in especially to be with the family. Bongekile was concerned about the well-being of their babies, especially as she could not be with them in theatre and was unable to feed them as per their normal feeding schedule, Mabuela said.Speaking ahead of the procedure, paediatric surgeons Dr Mariza de Villiers and Dr Paul Stevens agreed that the twins had a good prognosis. This type of conjoined twins are known as omphalopagus twins, which means they were joined at the lower abdomen and do not share a heart, they said.Pre-operative assessments indicated that the babies did not share any other vital organs. That improved their chances of surviving the surgical separation and will also contribute greatly to them leading healthy lives going forward, De Villiers said.De Villiers said the twins were joined only by a bridge of skin, which made the operation simpler than if they shared vital organs. There are always considerable risks when separating conjoined twins but we have been cautiously optimistic all along that the operation would have a good outcome for both twins, she said. The fact that there was a skin bridge between them meant that there was sufficient skin to close the resultant surgical wound on each baby without the need for plastic surgery. KUTULLO MADISHA
