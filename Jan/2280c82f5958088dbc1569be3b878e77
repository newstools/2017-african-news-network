British rapper Tinie Tempah made his catwalk debut at London Fashion Week Men&#8217;s on Saturday with a minimalistic, casualwear collection inspired by architecture and &#8220;the everyday man&#8221;.The 28-year-old, known for hits such as &#8220;Written in the Stars&#8221; and &#8220;Not Letting Go&#8221;, opted for a simple colour palette of navy blue, grey, white and black to present his first creations of mainly loose tops, trousers and shorts for his menswear brand &#8220;What We Wear&#8221;.To the sound of a live music performance, models walked down the catwalk in zip jackets, large tops, drawstring shorts and ankle-length tracksuit-like trousers in cotton, neoprene, linen and nylon.The &#8220;Pleats &amp; Poppers&#8221; collection also featured subtle folds in designs and easy fastening on sleeves or the sides of trouser legs. The looks were accessorised with white sports shoes bearing the &#8220;What We Wear&#8221; logo at the back.&#8220;I was very much inspired by architecture, especially European architecture as well, travelling throughout Scandinavia and even now I think east London is starting to adopt a lot of that as well,&#8221; the rapper told Reuters backstage.&#8220;And then again it was the everyday London man&#8230;I&#8217;m excited to be able to get my vision of the way I see menswear in 2017 going onto 2020 and beyond.&#8221;Tempah, who has designed clothing before, said the line would launch in April and that he would also consider doing a collection for women&#8217;s wardrobes eventually.&#8220;To be honest I got a little bit bored of people just saying I was really stylish just for wearing other people&#8217;s clothes,&#8221; he said of his decision to launch the menswear line.&#8220;After a while I feel like people start to put more of the emphasis on the clothes than the actual person&#8230;I started to feel like I was a bit of a walking mannequin.&#8221;Asked if fashion could now take his focus away from music, he said: &#8220;No&#8230;Music is always the core focus.&#8221;London Fashion Week Men&#8217;s runs until Monday. -Reuters
