Invest South Africa, an initiative of the Department of Trade and Industry, remains determined to attract more domestic and foreign direct investments in the country this year by going the extra mile to achieve this task. We will be working hard to bring in much-needed investment as part of government s efforts to achieve full-scale industrialisation, inclusive economic growth and job creation, head of InvestSA Yunus Hoosen said. Last year we saw the launch of one multimillion-rand investment a month from January to December, thereby creating thousands of jobs in South Africa. Last year s investments included that by Beijing Automotive Interactive Corporation (R11bn), ACWA Power (R5bn), Ford (R2.5bn), Sumitomo Rubber (R2bn), Nestle (R1.2bn), Cipla (R1.3bn) and Toyota (R500m), which provide evidence that the country has not lost its lustre as an investment destination.InvestSA is an internationally recognised and award-winning division of the DTI. This includes investment promotion, facilitation and aftercare, all of which are geared at fast-tracking projects and reducing government red-tape.It is also tasked with the responsibility of facilitating the increase in the quality and quantity of foreign and domestic direct investment by providing an investment recruitment, problem-solving and information service to retain and expand investments. InvestSA has a good investment pipeline with a number of investment projects we will be working on again, Hoosen said.He said the work of InvestSA and the investment profile of SA have been significantly enhanced by the international recognition that InvestSA received last year.These include the global winner award for excellence in partnering for investment promotion by the UN Conference on Trade and Development and the runner-up award at the annual investors meeting in Dubai for promoting investment in sustainable development.It was also recognised by CFI, the United Kingdom renowned international business journal, for its work in attracting investment to SA.InvestSA will launch the National One-Stop Shop in Pretoria soon and then roll out to all provinces over the next three years, Hoosen said.The OSS will be the focal point of contact in government for all investors to coordinate.It will also facilitate with the relevant government departments involved in regulatory, registration, permits and licencing.Sello Rabothatasellor@thenewage.co.za
