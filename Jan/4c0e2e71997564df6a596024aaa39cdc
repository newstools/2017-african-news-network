TROUBLE-PRONE singer Kelly Khumalo s son with rapper Molemo Jub Jub Maarohanye, Christian, was one among many Grade 1 pupils who had their first day at school yesterday.The six year old was born almost two months after Jub Jub and friend Themba Tshabalala crashed into a group of school children in Protea, Soweto, where four of them died and two others were seriously injured in 2010.His first day at schools comes just under a week after the release of his father on parole. Jub Jub and his friend only served four years of their eight year jail sentence, which was initially reduced from 25 years.While the Ndikhokhele hit maker has not commented on his release and his immediate plans since his return home, Khumalo shared a picture of her son on Instagram yesterday.In the picture, Christian is dressed in his full school regalia accompanied by the words: As he gets ready for school a big part of me is extremely happy yet emotional.https://www.instagram.com/p/BPHTbC5B1wf/?taken-by=kellykhumalozaNONTOKOZO GXUMISA
