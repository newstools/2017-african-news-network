The 2017 school year got off to a great start last week. Gauteng s class of 2016 remained in the top three nationwide with an impressive 87% matric pass rate.But a thought should go to children who did their best and did not succeed. For this reason, on January 3, ahead of the announcement of the matric results, the Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini announced that the Department s Gender Based Violence Command Centre (GBVCC) was available to matriculants to help deal with depression and suicide that tend to be on the increase during this time. The Command Centre can be reached toll free on 0800428428. Callers can also request a social worker from the command centre to contact them by dialling *120*7867# (free) from any cellphone. Callers can also interact with the centre using Skype. Just add HELPME GBV to your contacts and a social worker will accept the invite and call you back.To ensure effective teaching from day one, the Gauteng government conducts oversight visits to schools.I was with the SA Sports and Recreation Deputy Minister Gert Oosthuizen, Gauteng legislature members including Refiloe Mogale, and the city of Tshwane councillors in Rethabiseng in Bronkhorstspruit.We visited Rethabile Primary and Mpumelelo Secondary. These visits serve as re-assurance that education remains apex priority for the Gauteng government.Rethabiseng township, however, will humble anyone. Here the South African reality of how unequal a society we are hits you in the face. Many pupils are from child headed households. They eat at school and nowhere else.As such, some children as young as 10 vandalise schools at night scavenging for leftover food from the schools nutrition programme.Teachers are called to do more than just teach, their humanity is tested and stretched.One such teacher is 43-year-old Cynthia Mthombeni who heads the Bana Pele Programme at Phumelela Secondary.Bana Pele is a Gauteng government social development programme that assists pupils with their social needs.Because of the sheer size of the demands, she finds herself having to use her own money to buy pupil s uniforms and undergarments, among others. We appreciate the work of social development especially with the provision of uniforms.However, I would like you to extend the programme to even more pupils and to include the undergarments as well, Mthombeni said at the oversight visit.Much to her and the pupils appreciation, we gave out 250 sets of school uniforms to deserving kids at both schools.The Gauteng government may not be able to provide all that Mthobeni needs.At least not in this financial year and certainly not working alone. But we heard her and millions more who are in her position.As such, in the next two and half years, the Bana Pele programme will supply 1.4 million school uniforms and 2 million dignity packs (including sanitary pads for girls), to schoolchildren in previously disadvantaged communities across Gauteng.We also aim to increase the number of beneficiaries of our food relief from food banks and the government food security programmes increased to fight urban poverty. These households will be profiled and referred for interventions via the National Integrated Social Information System.Furthermore, we are implementing genuine empowerment programmes for our people to move them from dependency to self-reliance.The Welfare to Work is our fifth key priority and is allocated a budget of R18m.We urge communities to work with the government because it is only when we work together that we can respond better to the needs of our children.The South Africa s National Association of Child Care Workers together with social development have developed a community-based care and protection intervention option for children, named Isibindi, a Zulu word, meaning courage in English.The Gauteng government supports Isibindi projects by linking community-based organisations with a national support network and information feed. Isibindi enables poorly resourced communities to adopt an evidence-based approach to the provision of integrated welfare services, and rapidly develop effective and informed local care and protection services for children.In Gauteng, the Isibindi matric class of 2016 performed very well. There were 423 Isibindi matric candidates comprising 57% females and 43% male.They registered a pass rate of 78% (329 passed) with the highest percentage achieving a diploma pass, followed by a Bachelor s pass and Higher Certificate pass. This confirms that your altitude is determined by your attitude, not your circumstances.All Gauteng pupils have opportunities to better their lives. As social development, we have a bursary scheme that promotes career development within the social development professions and scarce skills.We assist those considering a career in community development, social work, clinical psychology, occupational therapy, demography and population studies.Those who would like to apply, may contact Veli Ngobese at 0112270065, Dikeledi Kutu at 0113557616 or may visit the department at 75 Commissioner Street, Perm Building, or any of the offices situated in Gauteng or any social development regional office at municipal offices. Do note applications are open between September and October meaning we will open this year for application to study next year.Those who would like to work, or who would like to find work-related skills, the Gauteng government has the Tshepo 500000 Programme to help young unemployed graduates and matriculants to acquire further skills development, transitional placement such as internships, sustainable employment and or participate in entrepreneurship.Those who want to register may dial 120*874376# and follow the prompts.The Gauteng government, under the ANC, has made today much better than yesterday.Today s youth have opportunities to make tomorrow better than today. I urge everyone to grab these opportunities while they exist.Nandi Mayathula-KhozaNandi Mayathula-Khoza is Gauteng MEC for social development
