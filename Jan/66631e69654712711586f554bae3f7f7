Exactly a year after former south coast estate agent Penny Sparrow unleashed a tirade against black people over the use of beaches, another storm is brewing over Durban s coastal spaces, this time pitting the ANC Youth League and the Blythedale Ratepayers Association on the North Coast.The tiff between the two organisations follows an open letter addressed to the KwaDukuza municipality in which the association, representing homeowners of the upmarket Blythedale coastal suburb near Ballito, complained about the behaviour of some Blythedale beachgoers who happened to be mainly black at this time of the year.However, the ANCYL in the greater KwaDukuza region, did not take kindly to the association s complaint where it described the behaviour of the beachgoers as absolute mayhem . These complaints are not genuine and justifiable on the basis that only Blythedale Beach is targeted primarily because is used by the majority of young black people in general and Africans in particular, ANCYL KwaDukuza regional secretary Musa Zondi said.In its letter, the association, which described the influx of people at the beach during the festive period as total debauchery made it clear that it was not impressed with the festive frenzy. In aerial photographs taken the next morning, the streets were gridlocked with minibus taxis and a number of partygoers appeared to have passed out on the side of the road, in between Styrofoam food containers and glass bottles, a spokesperson for the association who did not want his named published for fear of reprisal, said.However, the ANCYL has rejected the association s complaint. At the core of these people s flimsy complaints is bottomless hatred for the black folk; it is those elements who suffer from apartheid era hangover. The unfortunate part is the fact that we are yet to hear complaints from the same circles in relation to events such as Ballito Pro and Rage matric events which is attended mainly by whites. Ironically, it is public knowledge now that these events are equally characterised by similar levels of intoxication yet their silence is deafening as if it is business as usual, Zondi said.In September Sparrow was fined R5 000 or 12 months in prison for crimen injuria after describing black people visiting a south coast beach as monkeys. The association could not be reached for comment.provinces@thenewage.co.za
