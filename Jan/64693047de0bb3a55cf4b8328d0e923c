Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni left hospital and held a cabinet meeting on Saturday following the heart procedure he underwent earlier this week, his office said.Doctors at Rome&#8217;s Gemelli hospital said the 62-year-old, who took office last month, had made an excellent recovery from the emergency angioplasty they performed to unblock a blood vessel late on Tuesday.Gentiloni, formerly foreign minister, took over as premier when Matteo Renzi resigned after his proposed reform of the constitution was rejected by Italians in a Dec. 4 referendum.An opinion poll in daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday gave Gentiloni&#8217;s government an approval rating of 33 percent, up from 25 percent a month ago, just after he took office.The same poll said the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is now Italy&#8217;s most popular party, with 30.9 percent of voting support, just ahead of Renzi&#8217;s centre-left Democratic Party, on 30.1 percent.-Reuters
