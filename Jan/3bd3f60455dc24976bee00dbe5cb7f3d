European Union president Donald Tusk said Tuesday that British Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s speech on her plans for Brexit provided a &#8220;more realistic&#8221; picture of what London wanted.&#8220;Sad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit. EU27 united and ready to negotiate after Art 50,&#8221; Tusk wrote in a tweet.May has said she will invoke Article 50 of the EU&#8217;s Lisbon treaty to begin the Brexit negotiations by the end of March.Separately a spokesman said European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker was briefed &#8220;with interest&#8221; on May&#8217;s address.Juncker was in regular contact with her and a &#8220;courtesy phone call is scheduled between the two leaders later today,&#8221; the spokesman said.In her speech, May said Britain will leave the EU&#8217;s single market in a clean break from the bloc so that it would regain control over immigration.At the same time, London will seek a trade deal giving &#8220;the greatest possible access&#8221; to the single market after Brexit, she said.-AFP
