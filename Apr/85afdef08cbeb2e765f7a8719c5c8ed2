&nbsp;Newly-appointed Minister of Finance has said the Gordhan vs Oakbay case would not be withdrawn. Gordhan approached the North Gauteng High Court for a declaratory order confirming that he cannot intervene between Oakbay and the banks following the closure of banks accounts belonging to businesses associated with the Gupta family. &#8220;I think that the issues that are before the courts will remain before the courts until they are resolved at that level, Gigaba said. Because I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s my responsibility right now to take any decision either to withdraw cases or to plead differently in cases that have been lodged against us. So the current case is not going to be withdrawn.&#8221; The court has reserved judgment on the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;
