Berning Ntlemeza has filed an interdict against the new Police Minister Fikile Mbalula from preventing him from doing his job as the head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation &#8211; as the Hawks are formally known. Tuesday&#8217;s interdict calls for Mbalula to be restrained from &#8221; interfering unlawfully with the performance of official duties by the Applicant (Ntlemeza) as the National head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks)&#8221; This comes after Mbalula on Tuesday repeated once again that Ntlemeza was no longer head of the Hawks as per a court ruling setting aside his appointment. Earlier in the month the North Gauteng High dismissed, with costs, Ntlemeza&#8217;s leave to appeal application. &#8220;I am advised by my legal representatives that these statements by the First Respondent (Mbalula) are erroneous because, as already stated, my appeal has automatically suspended the enforcement order i.e the order by the Full Court that its main judgement delivered on 17 March 2017 should be brought into operation notwithstanding any application for leave to appeal,&#8221; said Ntlemeza The interdict also seeks to prevent the Police Minister from making any public statements which will &#8221; embarrass, humiliate, denigrate, undermine and subject the applicant (Ntlemeza) to contempt and ridicule.&#8221; During a press conference held on Monday at the Hawks headquarters Mbalula made a number of remarks directed at Ntlemeza including: &#8221; Ntlemeza is not defying me. Me and him can box in the street. This is not about me and him.&#8221; He also said the Hawks head should realise that this was real life not KC and Jojo and when he demanded that Ntlemeza immediately return the state car he took from the office said the Hawks head was accelerating, he is doing 300Km per hour. Even Ferrari doesn&#8217;t do 300km per hour&#8221;.In the interdict Ntlemeza goes on to say &#8220;what is most hurtful are the gratuitous, vilifying remarks the respondent (Mbalula) continues to make about me in the media. This damaging to me personally but also to the image of the DPCI.&#8221; He said he was &#8220;in the afternoon of his career&#8221; with the police and wanted to leave the SAPS gracefully . Ntlemeza is also seeking to be granted access to his official vehicle and cellular phone in his capacity as Hawks head. On Monday Mbalula ordered the police to ensure that Ntlemeza returns the car he took as he was longer the head of the Hawks. Ntlemeza also wants Mbalula to pay the full costs of his application out of his own pocket.
