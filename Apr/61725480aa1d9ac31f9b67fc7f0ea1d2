Update: According to unconfirmed reports axed Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza has reported for work on Monday.BREAKING: We have been reliably informed that #Ntlemeza has snuck in to the Hawks&#8217; offices, and is back at work. pic.twitter.com/FqHanCq5Sc Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 24, 2017Earlier: The DA is this morning picketing outside the Hawks headquarters in Pretoria after former Hawks head, Berning Ntlemeza, vowed to return to work today.Two weeks ago the North Gauteng High dismissed his application for leave to appeal which meant he had to vacate his office with immediate effect.Ntlemeza was appointed permanently to the position by former Police Minister Nathi Nhleko in September 2015, despite Judge Elias Matojane having found that the General lacks integrity and honour and had lied under oath.&#8220;While it appears that Ntlemeza filed for leave to appeal at the Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday, Minister Fikile Mbalula can and must use his power in terms of the South African Police Services Act and suspend Ntlemeza,&#8221; said DA Shadow Minister of Police, Zakhele Mbhele#Ntlemeza Zakhele Mbele from the @Our_DA explaining the reason for their gathering outside the Hawks&#8217; office in Pretoria @The_New_Age pic.twitter.com/d8POUquOzg Kutullo (@kutulloMadisha) April 24, 2017Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has previously said that he will not tolerate indiscipline within the ranks of the police after it was reported that Ntlemeza intended returning to duty.&#8220;The law will be executed. We don t need the drama. I m not going to entertain what Gen Ntlemeza is saying to the press. There is no stand-off. I m the minister of police not Ntlemeza, said Mbalula.Mbalula has since appointed General Yoliswa Matakata as acting head of the Hawks.-TNA Reporter
