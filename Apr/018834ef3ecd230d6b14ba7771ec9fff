Universities are already reeling from under-funding of the sector, which will now worsen. It was, therefore necessary to avert the crisis.&#8220;Economic instability will make it difficult for graduates to participate actively in our economy. It will deepen racialised and gendered divisions in education, the labour market and society,&#8221; the statement read.&#8220;For these reasons, we support all calls for transparent and accountable government, inclusive economic growth and challenging inequality in our society.&#8221;&#8211; ANN7 reporter
