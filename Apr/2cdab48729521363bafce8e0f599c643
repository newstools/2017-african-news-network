The Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) said it is worried about the Standard &amp; Poor s (S&amp;P) global ratings downgrade as it will have inflationary results.&#8220;We are worried about the &#8220;junk status&#8221; will have inflationary results as it would result in an increase in borrowing costs not only for the government but across the economy,&#8221; said Cosatu General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali.We are worried that the #Junkstatus will have inflammatory results on the working class says Bheki Ntshalintshali @business @busrep @Fin24 pic.twitter.com/61Wr6ckv4j @COSATU Today (@_cosatu) April 4, 2017We express our disapproval of the credit rating agencies, S&amp;P&#8217;s decision to downgrade the country to a #Junkstatus @Fin24 pic.twitter.com/8ToiA8rRWb @COSATU Today (@_cosatu) April 4, 2017Cosatu said this while briefing the media on the Post Special CEC.The decision to initiate a review for downgrade was prompted by abrupt change in leadership of key government institutions, the rating agency said in a statement on Monday.South Africa s sovereign credit rating is currently two notches above non-investment grade at Baa2.Ntshalintshali said what is more worrying is that according to the National Treasury the budget for 2017/18 totals R 1.56 trillion of which revenue covers R1.41 trillion. The remaining R149 billion will be borrowed and there is strong possibility that South African government will be forced to further raise taxes to fund most of its spending.&#8221;He also indicated that South Africa owes more than R2.2 trillion which is more than 50.7% of the national income or GDP and pay R160 billion per annum in interest payment, which is very close to what government spends on social grants.Cosatu also stated as the federation they no longer believe in the leadership abilities of President Jacob Zuma and will be communicating with the ANC and Alliance partners. We think that after all his undeniable contribution to both the movement and government, the time has arrived for him to step down and allow the country to be led forward by a new collective at a government level, said Ntshalintshali.&#8211;TNA Reporter
