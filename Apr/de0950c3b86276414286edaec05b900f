&nbsp;The DA has filed an urgent court application with the North Gauteng High Court to force President Jacob Zuma to provide reasons for reshuffling his Cabinet.The DA has requested the court to compel President Zuma to provide a written record of his decision and reasons for the reshuffleThe DA wants Zuma to show that his decision was arrived at rationally.&#8221; It is &#8230;critical that the President make known the reasons for and record of his decision so that its rationally can be tested.&#8221;&#8221; In our papers we argue that the President s assertion that the DA, and indeed South Africa, is not entitled to the record and reasons for his cabinet reshuffle is incorrect in law and because the President s reshuffle amounts to the exercise of executive powers granted to the President in terms of Sections 91 and 93 of the Constitution, on the President s own admission, it is subject to the principle of legality and the principle of rationality, said the DA&#8217;s James Selfe.The DA, in particular, want the President to explain why he decided to remove former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. The effect of his decision on South Africa is plain for all to see and led directly to two international rating agencies downgrading our country to junk status. &#8220;&#8221; Our currency also went into free-fall and will, in all likelihood, lead to job losses which we can ill-afford given that a staggering 8.9 million South Africans cannot find work,&#8221; said Selfe.President Zuma who announced his reshuffle on 31 March, said he was doing so &#8221; in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness.&#8221;The President has also asserted that he was well within his rights to make changes to the national executive as he is empowered through the constitution.&#8220;The decision to reshuffle cabinet as he did was informed by his political judgement that the reshuffle will best deliver on the mandate of the African National Congress,&#8221; Zuma previously responded to the DA through the State Attorney.
