The revival of hospitality studies was in sharp focus yesterday as the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, launched a first-ever digital hospitality studies curriculum aimed at teachers and pupils from Grade 10 upwards.The course is set to provide support and capacity for both teachers and pupils and also serve to create awareness at secondary school level about potential careers in the fast-growing hospitality industry.At the launch in Tembisa on the East Rand yesterday, Motshekga said: It cannot be emphasised enough that the children of the 21st century require ICT integrated learning and teaching in order to compete well in the global village. This conscious decision to incorporate ICT into the learning space is not a leap of faith. In fact it is line with the vision for the next half century dubbed Agenda 2063. Studies undertaken by the department revealed a steady decline in hospitality studies offered by secondary schools since 2008.The lack of funding has been identified as one of the main reasons for this.The cost of equipment, a lack of training opportunities for teachers and a resultant shortage of suitably qualified teachers are also among the factors adding to the decline. It is no brainer to say that by introducing this programme, the teaching and learning of hospitality studies will improve significantly. Through the effective use of technology and by integrating the well-developed subject resource materials into teaching and learning the goal and outcome of 21st century education for the 21st century hoteliers is indeed achievable, Motshekga said.There are 300 schools across the country offering hospitality studies as a matric subject and 100 of these have been identified by the department to start receiving training and equipment. The remainder will follow later.Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training Mduduzi Manana will roll out the 2017 Apply Now/Khetha Career Guidance Campaign at three schools in the Nquthu local municipality on Monday.The department s Busiswa Gqangeni said: The campaign is aimed at encouraging secondary school pupils to apply on time for admission to post-school institutions and thus avert possible stampedes and long queues that take place at the beginning of each academic year. The career guidance component of the campaign seeks to inform pupils about career choices available within the post-school sector. The roll out of the campaign is targeted at far flung and often neglected rural areas, villages and townships to ensure that pupils in those areas make informed career choices.Manana will speak to pupils from Grade 9 to 12 and further promote the 100 occupations in high demand list released by the minister in 2014.LILLIAN SELAPISA
