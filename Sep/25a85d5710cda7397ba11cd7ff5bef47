Advocate Terry Price has asked for a postponement of Christopher Panayiotou’s murder trial until Wednesday because witnesses were not available. It was expected that the defence will call about five witnesses including Panayiotou’s “mistress” Chanelle Coutts family members and a policeman. Price said the witnesses will be available tomorrow. The court heard in June that a man initially approached to carry out the alleged hit on Jayde Panayiotou had been phoned 17 times by Christopher Panayiotou’s mistress Coutts. The state closed its case in June where a secret video recording in which PE businessman Panayiotou seemingly discussed his wife, Jayde’s murder, was allowed to be played in court. Panayiotou and his co-accused, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko, are facing charges of con­spiring, kidnapping, robbing and killing Jayde Panayiotou on April 21, 2015. Even though it is still not clear whether Panayoutu will be testifying, it is reported that the alleged hitman Nemembe and co-conspirator Sibeko will be granted an opportunity to present their case over the next two weeks. Panayotou’s former worker Luthando Siyoni turned a state witness but became a hostile witness when he denied all the conspiracy regarding the plotting of Jayde’s murder. In 2016 suspected hitman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke died in Livingstone hospital, he was allegedly hired by Jayde Panayiotou’s husband, Christopher, 29, to kidnap and murder her in 2015. Jayde was abducted from outside her Kabega Park townhouse complex while waiting for her colleague to give her a lift to Riebeek College Girls’ High School in Uitenhage where they both worked as teachers.
