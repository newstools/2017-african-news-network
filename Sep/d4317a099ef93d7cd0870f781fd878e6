A BLUNDER that ended up in a Walter Sisulu University (WSU) student receiving R14m into her account has turned into a blame game between the university and IntelliMali, the external company contracted to handle its finances.The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS), WSU and IntelliMali appeared before the parliamentary committee on higher education and training yesterday to explain how R14m was erroneously paid to a student.Sibongile Mani, an accountancy student at WSU, was supposed to receive R1 400 as a recipient of a NSFAS loan but mistakenly received a pot of gold. She went on a spending spree before being found out about five months later having spent R818000.According to findings by IntelliMali, the student had already spent more than R21000 on the first day of receiving the money.The university has put the blame on its service provider, saying at the end March this year it prepared an Excel spreadsheet to cover three months food allowance, amounting to R4 200 a student and submitted the schedule to IntelliMali.At the end of May it used the same spreadsheet to add a further R1 400 a student. WSU records indicate that the spreadsheet details sent from WSU to IntelliMali up to the end of May 2017 correctly indicated allowances of R1 400 a student and in particular, R1 400 for Ms Mani, a report by WSU said.However, IntelliMali said it was not responsible for the bungle and that the file was processed correctly and the system feedback confirmed that Mani had indeed received R1 400.TNA REPORTER
