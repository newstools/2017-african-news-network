THE Springboks will have to make do without eighth man and captain Warren Whiteley for the remaining two Rugby Championship matches against Australia and New Zealand. Whiteley has been battling with a long-term groin injury that saw him miss the Lions’ Super Rugby final and the start of the Rugby Championship. Uzair Cassiem has done well in the
position but there is no doubt that the team have been missing Whiteley’s leadership, especially in away games. Bok team doctor Konrad von Hagen said the 30 year old was now in the final phase of his rehab and should be back to full fitness in time for the end-of-year campaign. “It’s the final phase of his rehab and then it is just a matter of getting him fit,” Von Hagen said. Whiteley was injured in the June Test series against France but was initially expected to return midway through the southern hemisphere tournament. The Boks will need some positive news ahead of the match against Australia on Saturday, especially on the
back of a 57-0 loss to the All Blacks two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Wallabies lock Adam Coleman said his side will be expecting an improved Springbok team out to prove themselves on Saturday. Despite their loss to the All Blacks,
the Boks still remained a dangerous side, he said. “I feel like they’re going to be a team that want to prove something. They’re a good side. One rainy day doesn’t make it winter for them. “I know they’re really going to bring it to the table in Bloemfontein and show home-grown support means a lot to them,” Coleman said. The last time the Wallabies and the Springboks met three weeks ago in Australia, the teams could not be separated, with the match ending in a 23-23 draw. mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za -Mmasekepe Matsebane
