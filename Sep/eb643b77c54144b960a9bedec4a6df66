I have reached a stage where I have to take a decision whether we have a school or we don’t have one, said Gauteng MEC of Education Phanyaza Lesufi. This comes after 12 teachers and two other personnel did not pitch at Klipspruit West Secondary on Monday as schools were expected to resume. “We will consult with the parents on Thursday to indicate whether they want us to have a school or not,” he said. Lesufi is set to meet with the provincial leadership and the leadership of the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu). The union last week pulled out all teachers affiliated with it from all schools in Eldorado Park. “At 12 pm today I will be meeting with the disgruntled teachers that are not at work, just to give them an opportunity to pursue me on why they are not at school and at 2 pm I will be meeting with the teachers that are at school to understand whether the situation at the school its fine or not, and also to hear what support they need,” said Lesufi.  Last week, the union pulled out all teachers affiliated with it from all schools in Eldorado Park. Lesufi was speaking after a clean-up at Klipspruit West Secondary School, known as the Moral Regeneration Movement, led by father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa. The campaign forms part of the iCare We Care campaign against the destruction of public property and vandalism as the surrounds of the school has been used as a dumping site. Human settlements, cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Jacob Mamabolo, who was the acting education MEC while Lesufi was abroad last week, said the Human Rights Commission had agreed to help with issues that affected the school. -TNA Reporter
