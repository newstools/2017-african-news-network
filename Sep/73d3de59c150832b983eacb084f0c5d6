Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has dismissed suggestions that midfielder Paul Pogba faces a lengthy lay-off because of a hamstring injury sustained in the Champions League defeat of Basel on Tuesday.Pogba, who captained United against the Swiss champions, limped off in the 3-0 win and some reports have suggested he could be out for 12 weeks with a muscle tear.Mourinho, however, said those suggestions were not based on truth and that the nature of the injury would not be known until after the results of further scans.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it is 12 weeks or 12 days, honestly,&#8221; the Portuguese said after United&#8217;s 4-0 win over Everton in the Premier League on Sunday.&#8220;Any comment or any new rumour is totally wrong because we don&#8217;t know if it is 12 weeks or 12 days. The player was diagnosed initially after the match because of the conditions of the muscle and the bleeding.&#8220;The decision was one more week to wait to see really clearly in the scans, that I mentioned, of the injury.&#8220;Nobody in this club spoke about 12 days or 12 weeks. Not at all. In the hamstring, it&#8217;s a normal procedure and we wait a few more days. So it&#8217;s completely nonsense information.&#8221;-Reuters
