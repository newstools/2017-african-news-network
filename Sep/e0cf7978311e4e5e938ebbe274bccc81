A 20-year-old student will appear at Pretoria Magistrate&#8217;s Court for after he walked in at Sunnyside police station on Monday evening and pleaded with the police to help him to recover his &#8220;stolen laptop&#8221;.It is said that he told the police that he had been robbed of his laptop by three armed men somewhere along Jorrisen Street, Sunnyside, last Thursday.The local detectives conducted follow-up interview which revealed inconsistencies in the statement that he had initially submitted to the police.The police say they found that the suspect had lent the laptop to his brother, who alleged later that it had been stolen.&#8220;The duo is believed to have reconciled that the suspect would inform the police that he had lost the laptop during a robbery, a move that would lead to the suspect being charged with perjury, an offence that carries a sentence of up to three years imprisonment,&#8221; police said.Captain Daniel Mavimbela said a team of local investigators has been tasked to analyse the data collected from persons who report/ed cases at the police station.&#8220;Thus far it appears as if there could be several cases of robbery, especially those involving cell phones and laptops, which could be false reports,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Persons who intend to open false cases should begin to think twice. In fact, misleading the police with false information is equivalent to wasting the resources of our community because the police are a resource.&#8221;TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
