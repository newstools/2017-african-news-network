WILDFIRES which flared up in some parts of the province early this week have been suppressed by firefighters from Working on Fire (WOF), a programme funded by the department of environmental affairs. WOF provincial spokesperson Matema Gwangwa said yesterday that the cause of the fires were still being investigated. Since the beginning of the week, 85 firefighters were dispatched for fire suppression on four different wildfires across the province. So far an estimated 16ha of vegetation in the Soekmekaar and Mookgopong areas were burned.The reports of hectares burned by the Lebowakgomo and Welgevonden fires are still pending, Gwangwa said. The situation was particularly hectic on Tuesday when WOF, while still on the fire line in Mookgopong, had to dispatch another team of firefighters to areas around Lebowakgomo where fires were raging on. Our fighters have been trained vigorously in fire suppression while our ground resources are working very hard with our stakeholders in saving lives and protecting the environment and properties from these raging fires, Gwangwa said.WOF, which forms part of the expanded public works programme funded by the national Department of Environmental Affairs, advised people never to ignite fires and to consult with their local municipalities before burning unwanted materials.Meanwhile, the department of water affairs and sanitation urged citizens in the province to keep on conserving water during this time of the year. In relation to the provincial water storage situation, the situation is still stratifying but the province still needs to continue to implement water restrictions to allow for a smooth recovery, department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said.montshom@thenewage.co.za-Montsho Matlala
