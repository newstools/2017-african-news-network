Since June last year, just more than a million households in South Africa have been victims of crime, a survey released by Statistics SA’s Pali Lehohla showed yesterday. Lehohla said the households made up a total of about 1.5 million crime incidents. Lehohla said that the victims of crime survey examined crime from the viewpoint of the victims and found that household’s confidence in police service and courts had been gradually eroding over the year. He said that some households held negative attitude about the police and 59% felt that the police could not recover stolen goods while some were disgruntled with court services saying they were too lenient towards criminals. “However, not all incidents of house break-ins were reported to authorities while in some cases they were reported to more than one authority. The survey showed about 7% of households in the country were victims of crime in 2016, compared to 9% in 2015-16,” he said. He further said crime experienced by households and individuals aged 16 years and older has been decreasing in the past year. “The estimated number of incidents of crime also decreased for many types of crime. “For example, housebreak-ins incidents decreased by 8%, home robbery decreased by 25% and that of personal property decreased by 12%. However, hijacking of cars increased and sexual offences increased by 93% and 110% respectively,” he said. A comparison of crime types shows that housebreaking was the most common crime experienced by households, followed by livestock at 11% and home robbery by 10%. Theft of personal property tops the individual crime list at 42% followed by assault 18% and robbery 16%. Male-headed households had a higher percentage of victimisation compared to female-headed households. Households headed by coloureds, 8.9%, were the most likely to be victimised and households headed by black Africans 6.9% were the least likely to be victimised by crime. Items stolen during housebreak-ins include electronic equipment, cell phones, jewellery, money and food. Lehohla also released statistics on births across the country. Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal have had the highest numbers with 235 218 and 198 628 babies being born in the past year. Relative to other months, March and September had the highest number of birth occurrences in these two provinces, implying the increase in June and December. The recorded live birth report shows that a total of 969 415 births were registered in the country last year. “This showed the decline of 10.6 % from the 1084 511 birth registered in 2015,” general statistician Pali Lehotla said. According to the report from the 969 415 births registered last year, 876 435 were current registration whereas 92 980 were late registrations from children born in 2015. The majority of children born in 2016 were males totalling 442 301. Most of the birth occurred to women aged 20-29. Lehohla said that no comparable or reliable information on fathers could be provided due to the high proportion (60%) of birth registered without details of fathers. The most popular names for born girls registered in 2016 were Precious, Princess and Amahle, while most popular in boys were Junior, Blessing and Gift. Most babies were born to surnames Dlamini, Nkosi and Ndlovu. KUTULLO MADISHA
