AFTER years of deliberation by intellectuals and the government in the agriculture sphere, the provincial government ensured that black farmers in red meat production become part of the country s mainstream economy.Rural development and agrarian reform department and the provincial rural development agency MEC Mlibo Qoboshiyane said the intention is to create profit and to make sure that butchery managers throughout the province are supplied by black farmers from rural areas. This would involve reducing the amount of meat bought from other provinces. The majority of the province s hotels, shops, public institutions, caterers, restaurants and butcheries purchase their meat from livestock farmers and abattoirs in the Western Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal, Qoboshiyane said.Following this, Qoboshiyane was pleased to announce the clean audit outcomes from the department. These were received from the auditor-general (AG) for the 2016-17 financial year. This sends a good message to the private sector and public sector investors that we want to partner with growing agriculture economic transformation in the province.He said the department and entity had prudent systems to ensure that investor s money was not wasted but worked for what it was intended for and gave returns on each investment. As a service delivery department that got a clean bill of health from the AG, Qoboshiyane said.He gave the assurance that the responsibility is more on them as a department to continue ensuring clean governance, especially with the implementation of our agriculture economic transformation strategy.He said it was difficult to say when this reduction of buying red meat from other provinces would come into effect as the province s farmers first had to produce more.However, progress in this matter is starting to prevail because in 2015, University of Pretoria masters student Fakudze Bhekine Delisile did research on the substantial and unexploited market opportunities for communal farmers in the Eastern Cape, and they own 3.3 million head of cattle. ComMark embarked on the Eastern Cape Red Meat Project in 2005 with the aim of increasing participation in formal markets by communal farmers, Delisile said.He then discusses the closure of ComMark in 2008, the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) was approached to take over the project since it had made a significant contribution to communal farmers through improved participation in formal markets.Delisile speaks of how NAMC embraced the opportunity by accepting the proposal and that was the birth of the National Red Meat Development Programme (NRMDP). NRMDP was established to improve income from animal husbandry and to create opportunities for communal farmers to commercialise, as well as participate in the formal markets. The decision to commercialise the province s livestock programme this year was taken because these farmers collectively owned nearly 3 million head of cattle, which Qoboshiyane said was the largest in the country.Qoboshiyane met provincial leaders of the African Farmers Association and National Emergent Red Meat Producers Organisation in Mthatha on Friday.They discussed how to help black farmers benefit from commercial livestock trading. However, challenges that the province has in terms of farming still remain to me as a work in progress. SISANDA MADWANTSI provinces@thenewage.co.za
