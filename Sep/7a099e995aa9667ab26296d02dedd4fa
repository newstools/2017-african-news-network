The department says that they have now embarked on a massive drive to eliminate rabies starting from this week where they will be conducting vaccination drives in several areas including, Appellsbosch, Ozwathini, Inanda, and Umlalazi. Meanwhile, the department will also be embarking on education campaigns across all the affected areas in the province. -TNA Reporter
