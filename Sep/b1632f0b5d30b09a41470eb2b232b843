AFTER the ANC Youth League in the Western Cape endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as its ANC presidential candidate, Cosatu in the province is set to opt for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa at the elective conference in December.The trade union federation has called a meeting of shop stewards from more than 1000 workplaces to promote Ramaphosa as the next ANC president and president of South Africa . The meeting is to be held at Community House tonight.Also invited to attend tonight s meeting are leaders of the ANC, SACP and South African National Civil Organisation. Cosatu said the gathering will show the support of alliance partners in the Western Cape for Ramaphosa. Cosatu will also use this meeting to mobilise its members to join the strike on September 27, for an end to state capture , corruption and the removal of President Jacob Zuma, who s presidency it claims has destroyed the economy.In a statement, Cosatu s Western Cape secretary Tony Erenreich slammed the DA-controlled city of Cape Town for refusing one of its affiliates, the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu), which will also be part of tonight s show of support for Ramaphosa, permission to use the Civic Centre for an after-hours meeting.This was in spite of Samwu having an agreement with the city to use the venue for report-back meetings with members. The DA had heard that Ramaphosa was coming to speak at the Samwu meeting and that Cosatu would also be present, so they denied the use of the hall to Samwu, Erenreich said. The reality is that the DA is trying to stop Ramaphosa from becoming president of the ANC, so he must not be exposed to the people of Cape Town. The people will see that the ANC is not President Zuma, who is an easy target to dismiss due to his many corruption charges and ill-discipline. The people will see that the ANC under Ramaphosa will provide the kind of leadership that provides the people of Cape Town with hope, Erenreich said. DENNIS CRUYWAGEN dennisc@thenewage.co.za
