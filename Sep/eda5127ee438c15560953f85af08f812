Five suspects in transnational crime syndicate nabbed for drugs and firearms will appear at the De Doorns Magistrates’ Court in Wynberg, Cape Town on Tuesday. Two German citizens, two South Africans and Malawian were arrested after raids on two Western Cape properties, which led to the seizure of items from a drugs laboratory and a number of firearms and ammunition. “An intelligence-led search and seizure operation that ran well into early hours of Friday morning was carried out by an integrated team comprising members from the Narcotics Enforcement Bureau [SANEB], Crime intelligence and K9 unit at a farm in Touwsriver and a house in Hout Bay,” Hawks Lloyd Ramovha said in a statement. Ramovha added that the search uncovered a clandestine drug production laboratory with hydroponic cannabis, dagga plants, cocaine, Lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], Methylenedioxyamphetamine [MDA] commonly known as ecstasy tablets, as well as equipment. “Two hunting rifles, a handgun and ammunition were also seized, and they are to be subjected to forensic examination to determine whether they were involved in the commission of crime,” said Ramovha. The suspects are facing charges related to drug dealing and illegal possession of firearms. TNA Reporter
