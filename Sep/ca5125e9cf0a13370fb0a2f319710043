THE trial of alleged Danish genital mutilator Peter Frederiksen was yesterday adjourned early to allow the state to finalise the list of witnesses who were expected to testify as the trial draws to a close.No witnesses were called to the stand yesterday as some had not made it to court. Frederiksen is on trial for allegedly mutilating nine women by removing their clitorises. The body parts were found in the freezer of his Langenhoven Park home prior to his arrest in 2015.On Monday afternoon forensic expert Priscilla Monyobo told the Free State High Court that it was illegal to remove blood or human tissue from a living person without their written consent.Monyobo who works as an assistant manager of clinical forensic medicine at the Free State health department said if a person was unconscious, blood or human tissue could only be removed with the written consent of a partner/ spouse or a guardian, particularly if it was a minor.She said human tissue may only be removed medically in an effort to heal the specific person. These procedures may be performed at a registered medical facility only, she told the packed court.Monyobo said Frederiksen s townhouse in Langhoven Park was not a registered medical facility thus no form of medical procedures should have been performed at the residential area, particularly without proper equipment.She testified that an application should be processed with the health department to have a premises registered as a medical facility and the application should clearly state which services would be rendered at the premises during the procedure.She told judge Johan Daffue that certain procedures which Frederiksen allegedly performed on women, were uncommon in the medical field. Monyobo said the accused was not qualified to perform such procedures.The court was also told about the day that he committed fraud with various firearm licence applications. Frederiksen was arrested in September 2015 after 21 clitorises were found in a freezer of his home.Some charges against him relate to the murder of his wife, 28-year-old Matseliso Molise. She was shot four times allegedly by hit men hired by Frederiksen outside her house in Maseru, Lesotho on October 20, 2015. The trial continues today.MICHAEL TLHAKUDI provinces@thenewage.co.za
