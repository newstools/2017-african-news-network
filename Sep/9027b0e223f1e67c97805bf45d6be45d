Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) said that they pledge to mobilize all of their resources to ensure that the senseless killings of mine workers stop.This comes after 50-year-old Mpeke Nonyana was gunned down outside the Impala Platinum mine in Rustenburg on Tuesday.Police spokesperson Amanda Funani, &#8220;Nonyana was walking towards the gate when shots were fired at him, the motive of the incident is still unknown at this stage and no one has been arrested.&#8221;Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa said it is not for them to speculate on the motive of the killings but nothing can justify the taking of another s life.&#8220;It is bad enough that our members are slaughtered on the mines by Management s failure to ensure basic health and safety. Just two weeks ago we lost another five mine workers to the dangers of going underground. Now, for workers to be killed by cowardly assassins is absolutely unacceptable.&#8220;The killing must stop. As the leadership of Amcu we make a call to the authorities, the police, Hawks, mine management to investigate thoroughly and bring the perpetrators to book. The case must be investigated without fear or favour,&#8221; said Mathunjwa.&#8220;Everyone must play their part to ensure that Mpeke Nonyana s killing is not allowed to be another unsolved murder, which only serves to embolden the criminals to continue with these dastardly deeds.&#8221;TNA Reporter &nbsp;
