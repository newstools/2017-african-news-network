THE University of Johannesburg (UJ) is mulling over making gender neutral toilets a permanent feature launching its pilot project earlier this month.The university has introduced a few unisex toilet facilities at its campuses as a response to calls made by the LGBTQI community. This initiative represents a significant step in the university s journey towards promoting inclusivity and recognising diversity, university spokesperson Herman Esterhuizen said.He said the decision came after a meeting with student leaders of the interim and central student representative council last month. During constructive and robust discussions, the student leaders, responding to calls from the LGBTQI community, requested management to consider the introduction of gender neutral or unisex toilets, he said.UJ has followed in the footsteps of Wits University, which introduced a unisex facility in May last year. The university also has a handful of such facilities across campuses. The UJ said the bathrooms would enable people who do not subscribe to gender binaries to use the facility of their choosing.However leading the pack in this movement is the University of Cape Town. They introduced gender-neutral bathrooms on campus in 2014, a move that sparked controversy.Lerato Phalakatshela, the project manager of the Love Not Hate campaign at OUT, said it was heartening to see that at least something was happening at universities.OUT is an organisation dedicated to the building of healthy empowered lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered communities in South Africa and internationally. The truth is things are happening at a slow rate. We are a country that accepts diversity and celebrates differences on paper but it is different when it comes to doing it, he said.He added that this should be extended to our daily lives where such facilities are introduced even at malls.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
