BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga will tomorrow visit the province as part of her Second Chance matric support initiative road show. Motshekga will be accompanied by the education MEC, Martha Bartlett, and other government officials in Kimberley.Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said the road shows were designed to create awareness around the options available for out of school youth, who had not been able to meet the requirements of the national senior certificate to get their matric. Data from the 2011 National Census showed that the unemployment rate for 25 to 35 year olds who have less than matric was 47% in 2011, Mhlanga said. Much higher than those 25 to 35 year olds that had a matric making up about 33%, a diploma or certificate, 20% and about six times higher than for those with a bachelor s degree or higher. Mhlanga said over the period 2008- 15, unemployment rates were the lowest among post secondary qualification holders and the highest among those who dropped out without completing secondary schooling. The matric certificate is an extremely valuable qualification, it gives people the opportunity to further their studies and improve their likelihood of employment. It is for this reason that we are giving those who have not managed to qualify for their National Senior Certificate a second chance to get a matric and therefore a second chance at attaining a better and more prosperous life. We encourage those who are interested in taking a second chance at writing matric, he said.provinces@thenewage.co.za-TNA Reporter
