The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal is shocked and saddened by the murder of four young siblings who were found stabbed at their home in Port Edward on Saturday. The four children between the age of 4 and 12 were discovered dead with stab wounds on Saturday. It is reported that three of the children were found with their left ear mutilated. It is extremely abhorring that these children were not only murdered but also had some of their body parts removed. The mutilated bodies of the Mbhele children, Lwandle (4), Siphindile (7), Lwandile (10) and Bandile (12) were found with multiple stab wounds. The children were bounded with ropes before being hacked and stabbed to death. The ears of the three children were severed, said the ANCKZN in a statement. The children are believed to have been home alone during this attack. We are calling on the community of Ngcukeni area in KwaNzimakwe village to work closely with the law enforcement agencies in arresting the perpetrator. &#8220;This strange behavior of murdering children undermines the future of our country and needs to be confronted by all sectors of society, said the ANC. The ANC further expressed its condolences to the Mbhele family and called upon the community members to remain calm and allow the police to conduct their investigations and refrain from taking the law into their own hands. -TNA Reporter
