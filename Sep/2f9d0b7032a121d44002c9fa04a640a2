Limpopo Police are investigating a mystery incident after they have discovered two bodies of partners in Chuniespoort Dam, Polokwane. A fisherman noticed a car driving fast towards the dam and alerted police. “It is alleged that on Sunday, September, 24 at about 08:00 am two partners both aged 19 years old were sitting inside a Toyota Tazz sedan near Chuenespoort Dam, subsequently the fisherman on a boat realized that the vehicle is now driving away at a very high speed into the water and he alerted the police,” said provincial spokesperson police Moatshe Ngoepe. Thabang Tladi and Kate Ramoshaba both aged 19 years old from Lebowakgomo Township were students at a Repeat Part Time Centre at Seleteng village in the ga-Mphahlele area. Ngoepe said during the recovery of the two bodies, the vehicle was also found but the cable snapped and the vehicle went deep down the water. “The search was then abandoned for the Rescue Team to get the additional resources to remove it,” he said. Ngoepe said although the motive behind this incident is unknown but domestic violence may not be ruled out. TNA Reporter
