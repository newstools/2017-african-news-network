A woman will on Wednesday appear in the Maphumulo Magistrates’ Court to face a murder charge after she allegedly strangled her eleven months old baby boy. It is alleged that the 21-year-old woman strangled and disposed of the toddler in a pit toilet at Ntombiyehlulunina, Maphumulo on Sunday. “After the woman disposed of the body, she then told the elders in the family that the child was missing and the police were immediately contacted,” said Colonel Thembeka Mbhele. “Seeing that she was cornered by the police officer, she spilt the beans. She admitted that she strangled her son and put his body in pit toilet after an argument with his boyfriend,” Mbhele added. The woman was later placed under arrest and the murder docket was opened at Maphumulo SAPS. The Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa praised the detective member for making sure that suspect is locked behind the bars. “It is outrageous to hear that the mother is capable of killing her own child. We hope that justice will be served and get a harsher sentence,” said Langa. -TNA Reporter
