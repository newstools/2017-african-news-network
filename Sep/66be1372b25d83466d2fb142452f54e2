The ANC Youth League in Free State has demanded a farm belonging to a farmer in Wesselsbron be given to local black people due to his racist behaviour he displays towards black people.The ANCYL spokesperson Sello Pietersen says the farm is used as a hub for inhumane activities, adding that it also exploits vulnerable poor South Africans. We call for the immediate shut down of this farm by the Department of Labour. The farm in question must be given to the local black people given that the current racist owner uses it as a hub for inhumane activities, Pietersen said.This comes after the department of labour opened a case against farmer in Wesselsbron after they discovered under aged children working on his farm.The farmer has allegedly been bringing people to work at his farm temporarily including minors. It is believed that he collected minors from North West province to work at the farm.Meanwhile, the human settlement and rural development advice Zondani Noveld said the farmer wanted to side step the law because they didn t want to pay people what was due to them in terms of labour law act. They know when they go to North West and get people who are frustrated who do not work they will agree to anything. They want also to side step our law called ester, which gives our people the right of residence, Noveld added.The provincial Youth league is expected to march to Wesselsbron Magistrate Court in relations to the farm owner s case.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
