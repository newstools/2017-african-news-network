OPPOSITION coalition politics which helped the DA wrest control of crucial metropolitan areas from the ANC is in a state of mayhem.This follows the EFF s refusal to sit at a round table for discussions with the DA triggered by the fallout between Nelson Mandela Bay mayor and DA leader Athol Trollip and his deputy mayor, Mongameli Bobani of the UDM.The DA, together with Cope and the ACDP, acted to remove Bobani, after months of consultation with the UDM about his alleged questionable conduct, which, according to the DA, sought to undermine and destroy the coalition agreement .The DA said its hand was forced after Bobani voted with the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay against the will of the people. This, in addition to being implicated in corruption in a department in the city he was responsible for.In protest against the DA s sacking of Bobani, the EFF boycotted a crucial meeting of the Tshwane council last week which had to be eventually aborted after the ANC walked out.Since then the EFF has continued its path of non-cooperation by refusing a DA request for an urgent meeting. It is a fact, that the 2016 elections outcome is such that we had to give the coalition of opposition parties a chance, at times led by the DA, to provide an alternative route out of the kleptocratic era the ANC has plunged us into. However, the DA is failing to hold the opposition parties together through mature, patient and humble leadership. They employ the same approach of an arrogance of power that has characterised the Nationalist Party and now the ANC, thus rendering the alternative opposition coalition local governments futile, the EFF said in a statement.The EFF further accused the DA of acting like supremacists for slamming its decision to boycott meetings of DA controlled councils in Gauteng and NMB. The very tone and choice of words expressed in the DA statement demonstrate the supremacist attitude we have been talking about all along. To refer to our decision as short sighted is proof of arrogance, always portraying their point of view as superior, the EFF said.Tshwane ANC spokesperson Tebogo Joala said the party felt vindicated that the unholy alliance between the DA and EFF was beginning to show signs of distress. This is an alliance of enemies against a common enemy. It was devoid of any ideological thinking and it has failed to make a meaningful impact to the lives of our people. Our people have been given a raw deal at the expense of the power hungry alliance, he said.KUTULLO MADISHAkutullom@thenewage.co.za
