ANC KwaZulu-Natal structures have supported the decision to appeal the court judgment nullifying the 2015 elective conference adding that they did not need permission from the National Executive Committee (NEC) to do so.Provincial structures including The Youth League and Women&#8217;s League told journalists during a media briefing that decision to appeal was a correct thing to do.&#8220;The PEC is appealing and we don&#8217;t need anybody&#8217;s permission not even the NEC&#8217;s. We are appealing today and the legal representatives have been instructed that they must file the intention to appeal,&#8221; said KZN ANCYL secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo.Related: ANC KZN leadership meeting with lawyers to prepare for appealANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said that there was an urgent need to meet structures of the party in the province to come to a solution.&#8220;Our view is that it is urgent that we meet and that urgency will answer all these questions. The danger is that we should not keep talking and making conflicting statements about what needs to happen before we even meet,&#8221; said Kodwa.Meanwhile, Sabelo said the decision to challenge the 2015 KwaZulu-Natal provincial congress was an attempt to derail their plans ahead of the national conference in December.&#8220;These comrades are contesting the national conference. If you look at the former chairperson Senzo Mchunu, he is up and down addressing chairs in Limpopo and the Free State.&#8220;The PEC is not voting in the national conference. It is the branches. these regions are intact. If they think this will destabilise our resolve on Mam Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma they must think again,&#8221; said Sabelo.&#8220;They participated. If you look at the role of Senzo Mchunu he even presented a political report in the province and when nominated he never said the conference was illegal,&#8221; he said.Related: If we voted tomorrow, Zikalala would be re-elected &#8211; ANCYL KZNMeanwhile, Sources close to Lawrence Dube, who brought the court application said that they would seek legal advice on how to force the provincial executive committee out of office while a possible appeal was under way.Another source close to Dube said they wanted to remove the eThekwini regional leadership which they believed was also installed irregularly.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
