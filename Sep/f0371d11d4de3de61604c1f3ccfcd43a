The North Gauteng Court has today dismissed Oakbay’s application seeking to interdict India based Bank of Baroda from closing the companies accounts at the end of the month. Judge Hans Fabricius delivered the verdict and ordered that Oakbay pay the costs of the application.  Earlier this month 20 companies falling under the Oakbay umbrella had asked the High Court to order the Bank of Baroda not to close the companies’ bank accounts at the end of this month. The Bank, which is the only remaining financial service provider for the Gupta owned companies said it faced a “reputational risk” should it continue to do business with Oakbay. The bank also argued that it has a tiny staff complement in SA which could not properly manage the accounts in line with international banking legislation. However, Oakbay had argued that Baroda’s argument of “reputational damage” did not withstand scrutiny on any factual basis. “The court must ask Bank of Baroda why it continued to work with Guptas for months and months and why the reputational damage question arises now,” Oakbay’s legal representative Rafik Bhana SC said. Also representing Oakbay, PJ Daniels SC said the bank had not mentioned “anywhere” the kind of reputational harm working with the 20 companies could cause and to what extent. “You are confronted with a half-baked version of reputational damage,” he argued before
the court. Bhana said Baroda was effectively the last chance for the Gupta-owned businesses. If no bank facilities are available to them, they argue, they will be unable to operate as businesses or pay the salaries of about 7 500 employees. -TNA Reporter
