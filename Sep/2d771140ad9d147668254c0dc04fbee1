An official from a contractor supplying electricity disconnection services to City Power is due to appear in court for fraud. This comes after the woman was arrested on Saturday after she allegedly tried to request bribe of R3000 from a resident in Midrand. It is said that the resident’s electricity account was in arrears and was served with a disconnection notice on Wednesday. It is alleged that the official approached the resident on the same day and informed her that she was there to disconnect the electricity. Johannesburg executive mayor, Herman Mashaba said, “The contractor then informed the resident that, if she paid her R3 000, her electricity would not be disconnected. “The resident had agreed to pay the money but said she only had R1 500 and requested that the official returned on Friday to collect the remainder,” said Mashaba. It was then the resident informed the city’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS) team, which set up a sting operation together with the members of the Hawks. “I am disturbed that this is becoming a trend in Johannesburg. Earlier this month, a contractor was also arrested for trying to solicit a bribe of R4 000 from a resident in Helderkruin, west of Johannesburg,” said Mashaba. Mashaba also emphasised that corruption had no place in the current administration. “We will work tirelessly, and in collaboration with institutions such as the Hawks, to ensure that it is eradicated and that residents of Johannesburg receive the quality services they deserve.” -TNA Reporter
