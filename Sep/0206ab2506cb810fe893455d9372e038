ANCYL KwaZulu-Natal chairperson, Kwazi Mshengu says the high court judgement nullifying the 2015 ANC elective conference should be appealed so as to not set a bad precedent.&#8220;What we are going to do is study the judgement but with the clear view that the decision must be appealed,&#8221; said Mshengu.The Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday declared the 2015 elective conference which saw Sihle Zikalala emerge victorious, unlawful and void following a complaint laid by a group backing ousted former provincial chairperson Senzo Mchunu.&#8220;We don&#8217;t think there should be cause for concern within the membership of the ANC and ANC Youth League in the province. The ANC Provincial Executive Committee remains and all its decisions are still remaining,&#8221; said Mshengu following the ruling.However, Mshengu&#8217;s assertion is in contrast to the ruling handed down by Judge Jerome Mnguni who said that &#8216;decisions taken at that conference are declared unlawful and void&#8217;.Mshengu added that they still were behind Zikala&#8217;s leadership despite the judgement and dismissed the claims of the rival group which had brought the matter to court.&#8220;Even if we elected tomorrow, comrade Sihle Zikalala would be re-elected as the chairperson of KwaZulu-Natal I have no doubt. What we don&#8217;t want is to create a precedent that if we fail to challenge this decision it may deliver a precedent that future conferences can be challenged on similar fictitious grounds.&#8221;Meanwhile, MKMVA NEC member Carl Niehaus also concurred that today&#8217;s ruling has to be challenged and that there will have to be a re-run of the conference.&#8220;The ANC has to deal with this matter politically and I am 100% sure that we will deal with this matter politically and also in this context but it cannot be a situation that the decisions of who will be the chairperson or who are the members of the National executives or the provincial executives of KZN can be determent by the court,&#8221; he said.Niehaus, however, said that it was unfortunate that the court had to intervene in political matters.&#8220;So at the end of the day, the ANC has to be ruled also in KwaZulu-Natal and each of the provinces by democratic ANC process.&#8221;-Siphiwe Mchunu and Simangele Legodi
