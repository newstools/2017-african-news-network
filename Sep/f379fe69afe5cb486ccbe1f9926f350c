A FORMER constable and two police informants were yesterday sentenced to three life terms and 18 years in prison by the North Gauteng High Court for the kidnapping, torture and murder of suspected criminals.The conviction and sentencing follows an investigation by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), after the bodies of three murder suspects, tortured and executed by the police officers and their informants investigating the case, were found in an isolated area of Carletonville in May 2015.Const Jim Maphale was the arresting officer in the murder case against Thabiso Mthembu, Andile Ndlovu and Tshepo Henry Nhlapo. Ipid national spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the three men were identified as murderers by informants Mpho Matlala and Lwazi Dlangamandla. One suspect was tortured until he passed out, Dlamini said. The police officer then took the suspect to a hospital where he was certified dead. They drove around with the body in their vehicle and took the other suspects to a field in Carletonville to cover up the evidence. The police officers shot the three suspects, but one escaped and was picked up by a passer-by who took him to hospital. Dlamini said one of the informants approached the police and the matter was reported to the Ipid. Police under the leadership of the commissioner, Gen Lesetja Mothiba, assisted in tracing the police officer who had absconded. It was established that some of the informants had been part of the killings, he said.The two constables who were based at Springs as detectives and two civilians had been on trial since May 22. One constable was acquitted of all charges. They were convicted of three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, one count of kidnapping and one count of defeating the ends of justice.dikeledir@thenewage.co.za-Dikeledi Ramabopa
