DIRT and sewage in Cape Town townships are an unhealthy social and mental existence for black people.THE apartheid policies of differentiated spatial development created and continue to perpetuate unhealthy and dangerous living conditions for black people and their children and they affect black women s aspirations for life.As relics of apartheid policies, especially migrant labour policies, they are now a nightmare for the future of black children.In a Facebook post, one of my friends wrote: There s no more articulate f**k you to black existence than spending a day in the suburbs with their temporary access to life and luxury, only to return to the permanent death of dirty and dangerous townships! The post articulated a long-held sentiment on the negative impact of the uncleanliness of townships on the social and mental health of black people and particularly on black women and children.The emphasis on black women is because they are the most marginalised group in black communities and the society in general.And challenges facing black communities usually trickle down to black women to shoulder.A walk around any of Cape Town s townships feels like life is snatched away by the dirty and sewage-flooded streets. The dirt overshadows any dreams and aspirations of black people and their children.As black people lead their daily lives in these townships, running informal businesses to raise their children, they do so under hazardous environmental uncleanliness.On weekends, for example, residents in the Strand are on the go with their errands, seemingly unbothered by the suffocating environmental challenge of dirt.At the Nomzamo Community Centre, the entrance is often flooded with sewage in the middle of its business operations with the residents.Fruit and vegetable traders overlook the conditions and continue trading with the residents even as they are operating around flooding sewage.Even in Kraaifontein, black women are selling braaied meat, fruit and vegetables in dirty streets.It seems normal. But is it normal for people to live so comfortably with dirt?With these type of living conditions, there are no appropriate words to describe the slow death-inducing experience of living and surviving in the slums of Cape Town. It is a crude existence that can only be explained by heartfelt and often explosive public outbursts like that of my friend s.In a lecture on the need for people to maintain clean environments, Dr Frances Welsing asked the question: Who defends trash? She argued that unclean communities do not inspire nor warrant confidence in social and business investments.The government, too, does not have a master plan on how to eradicate the objectionable conditions. Subsequently, entrepreneurship opportunities are lost because of the environmental uncleanliness.Black people s lack of coordinated effort to keep communities clean makes the public works street-cleaning programme ineffective.Seemingly, there is a lack of will from black people to collectively maintain and keep the communities healthy.Black women would benefit significantly from social and business investment opportunities. But their current living and business operation conditions are not conducive for expansive business opportunities.The uncleanliness of black communities is a major disabler for sustained social and business investments regarding black women.Not only are black women suffering in business terms, they also raise their children in these obscene conditions. It is a frequent image to see young children running and playing around overflowing sewage.With the lack of space and overpopulation in townships, black children do not even have adequate playgrounds to play in safe and in clean spaces.Lindiswa Jan is a researcher and masters candidate in the department of social anthropology at the University of Cape Town.
