Local civil society groups have called on an international finance body watchdog to look into a $107-million investment into Net1 and its subsidiary, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).The trio of civil groups namely Corruption Watch, Black Sash and Equal Education during the week filed a complaint with the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) of the International Finance Corporation (IFC).&#8220;It is clear that evidence of unethical and potentially unlawful conduct by CPS existed at the time at which the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, made its investment and that the lack of due diligence in respect of the investment is in breach of several provisions of the IFC Policy on Environment and Social Sustainability.&#8220;We have also submitted that the IFC has not taken sufficient steps to supervise and monitor the conduct of Net1 and its subsidiaries or to put measures in place to address and rectify impugned conduct,&#8221; said Corruption Watch in a statement.According to the groups, CPS is guilty of a number of offenses including &#8220;unauthorised and fraudulent deductions from the social grants of beneficiaries to the benefit of Net1 subsidiaries as well as unlawful and unethical use of social grant beneficiary data and information&#8221;.Earlier this year South Africa Social Security Agency CEO Thokozani Magwaza told parliament that the agency would stop this practice.Back in March, the Constitutional Court declared that the Sassa and CPS contract to pay social grants to be extended for 12 months after SASSA failed to come up with an alternative to the CPS contract which has been declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
