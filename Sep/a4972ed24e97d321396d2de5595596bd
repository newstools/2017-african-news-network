Most leaders seem to love the limelight. Some, when they have it, do not even want to share it.Cabinet minister and ANC NEC member Lindiwe Sisulu is an intensely private individual who appears to avoid the spotlight.Very little is known about her as a person.Very few will dispute the fact that she is attractive and fashionable. Better, she is highly educated, qualified, articulate and insightful.Unlike most of her peers and contemporaries, the limelight seems to love her more than she is interested in it.She is the kind of person who intuitively knows that one s character, especially one s good personal qualities, will one day bring you into the limelight.But the limelight is not for an individual to bask in its glory for its own sake. You have to use it, whatever it is, to bring enlightenment to the people.Sisulu seems to understand this for if you desire it for its own sake, it can be as dangerous as a candle to a moth or headlights to a rabbit.So, in an unobtrusive way, over the last few months she has emerged into the spotlight in quite a big way but has used the attention shone on her to highlight the plight of the people.A large part of her presidential campaign has been a humble one. No doubt a woman of her calibre and integrity knows that leadership is synonymous with visibility, but she has challenged this notion of leadership by holding back, not interested in blatant ambition and power.Sisulu, whose parents were both iconic leaders in the ANC, learnt from them that to be a true leader you do not need to be in the front or bask in the limelight.For example, the international community, recognised the first president of a democratic South Africa, Nelson Mandela, as a global statesman and icon.But few people know that Mandela was conscientised and recruited into politics and the ANC by Walter Sisulu, who was a humble and self-effacing leader. He did not bask in the limelight.Also, this holds true for her mother, Albertina, who worked as a nurse in the poorest of communities in Soweto all her life.Of course, the world fully recognised Mandela s wife, Winnie Madikizela, and dubbed her the Mother of the Nation .But others acknowledged Mma Sisulu as Albertina was fondly called as the true Mother of the Nation.She, too, like her husband, had dedicated her life to improving the quality of life of the poorest of the people. She did it out of selflessness, self-sacrifice and service to the people with no desire for self-aggrandisement.She was about identifying the needs of the people, to put them first above her personal interest.With both her parents now passed away, Sisulu s disposition to leadership revives the spirit and memories of her parents.At this time of identity crisis for the oldest liberation movement, its supporters and society at large are hungry for the spirit of the ANC that offered them so much hope.For almost 20 years now, since 1994 the people of this country have hankered after the revival of the ANC of old and the restoration of its values.For an increasing number of people, Sisulu is a welcome breath of fresh air in this jostling for power and position among ANC leaders.She is viewed as a splendid symbol of a selfless leader who desires to be a true servant of the people just like her parents.No one is sure of the actual strength of her constituency or backers but those who have observed her low-key campaign confirm that her ambition is to empower the people by restoring their faith in the ANC.They point to the fact that since the beginning of the year, she has crisscrossed the country to visit, engage and consult with the people on the ground, starting in the Eastern Cape where she was born.It was the people themselves that apparently nominated her to run for the presidency before she was ready to announce this step.Few will recall that in both the Mangaung and Polokwane conferences, influential people called out her name to show their support for they genuinely believed that she was a leader who reflected and epitomised the original values of the ANC.Those who are close to her testify that, unlike many other leaders in ANC, Sisulu did not go out of her way to become a presidential candidate.She has always understood that a leader does not have to declare his or her intentions to be a presidential candidate but can be handpicked by the people.Surveys continue to show her rising into second place in the race for the ANC presidency.To many, the race is increasingly a foregone conclusion, but cynics say the show is not over until the fat lady sings.They say out of the three women candidates that have been identified Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Baleka Mbete and Sisulu the latter s name is on the lips of the fat lady who will sing in December.Nobody can tell what will happen. There are more than 100 days before the ANC elective conference takes place. A lot can happen in that time.But Sisulu is one of the few remaining leaders of the ANC who symbolise the virtues of Africa s oldest liberation movement.Her advantage is that she is seen as holding an ongoing concern for all the people of South Africa.Some believe that it will be best for the ANC and the country to be led by a woman of integrity who is the living embodiment of ANC values and principles.As her campaign slowly gathers momentum, it will not matter whether Sisulu wins the race or comes out at number two. It is believed that she won t be below the two top positions.To many, she has already won the race by being in the forefront of restoring hope in the ANC and reviving its past glory.By doing this, she is not basking in the glory for herself, she is bringing back the ANC of old that holds people s hopes and aspirations.Sandile MemelaSandile Memela is a cultural critic and public servant.
