The time we developed Universities, we ignored the need of suitable accommodation for students after democracy, said Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande.Nzimande was speaking at the official handover of the newly renovated building of student accommodation at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Parktown on Thursday.The building was previously used as the Doctor s quarters and nurses residence. It consists of family units of 1, 2 &amp; 3 bedrooms, 16 floors of single rooms and 8 floors of Bachelor flats.The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) Vice-principle Professor Tawana Kupe has on Thursday said that the need for adequate student accommodation is a national issue.&#8220;It is an honour and pleasure for me to attend this ceremony as it addresses accommodation as it is one of the key issues wits and other institutions are facing in the higher education sector, said Kupe.Kupe added that they are deeply appreciative to the ministry for making sure that there is a temporary facility available that will ensure many students live in a suitable environment as they complete their students.Kupe also indicated that research has shown them that students who live in residences perform much better academically when compared to day students.&#8220;This can be attributed in part to some of the support programmes in place in residences but the assuredness and security of having a place at which to reside are also a major factor for success,&#8221; he said.MEC for Infrastructure Development, Jacob Mamabolo said that as the government they will be looking at pricing when it comes to these facilities.&#8220;Pricing will be one critical point that we will focus on because we know that many students would rather find cheaper accommodation because they can not afford accommodation.&#8220;We are busy looking for other resources to help them find land and that cannot be something that they will be done next year,&#8221; said Mamabolo.&#8220;Identifies the properties that are available for tertiary institutions in order to support the students accommodation&#8221;MEC Mamabolo HigherEduTrainingZA (@HigherEduGovZA) September 7, 2017The signing of the I Care, We Care pledge that vows to care for the property.
