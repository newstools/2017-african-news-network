The land grab case against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has on Friday been postponed to March 16, 2018.Malema s case is postponed due to him contesting the constitutionality of the Trespassing Act, which he believes it is no longer relevant in the current dispensation.The case comes after the comments he made at the EFF 2014 elective conference, where he told his supporters to occupy any vacant land they come across.However, the red beret leader filled court paper at the Pretoria High Court in June challenging the Constitutionality of the ACT.The papers were filled by his lawyer Tumi Mokoena at the time National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said Malema was challenging some sections of the Trespass act of 1956.Malema has been charged twice for the same Riotous Assemblies Act, one in Newcastle and in Bloemfontein respectfully.-TNA Reporter
