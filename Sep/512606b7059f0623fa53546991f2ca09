The City of Cape Town is taking a number of new actions to dive down water consumption including the introduction of level 5 water restriction fines and a further increase in pressure management.Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, said The upper limit of 87 litres per person and the overall target of 500 million litres per day of collective consumptions remain in place, however, there is now a new emphasis on capping excessive water use at the domestic household level and placing additional restrictions on the commercial sector.&#8220;Measures to drive down consumption to 500 million litres of water per day are supplemented by other measures to augment the supply of water from non-surface water options by up to 500 million litres of water per day, which are currently under way,&#8221; said de Lille.Since July, the City s goal has been to reduce consumption to 500 million litres per day.&#8220;As of last week, consumption stood at 599 million litres per day. With the winter rainfall season likely to end in the next three to four weeks, we simply have to get used to using less water as we enter the summer season,&#8221; she said.De Lille added that the usage in the month of September will determine what actions delinquent users will be subject to thereafter. Where non-compliance occurs, users can be subject to an admission of guilt fine or, in accordance with Section 36(4) of the City s Water By-law, the installation of a water management device (the cost of which will be billed to the account holder). An engagement with the Chief Magistrate is forthcoming, but the fines are expected to be in the region of R5 000 to R10 000. Confirmation of fines will be announced shortly, she said.TNA Reporter
