Serbia&#8217;s lesbian prime minister is set to take part in Belgrade&#8217;s Pride parade on Sunday, an event held yearly under heavy security after previous marches were disrupted by anti-gay violence.Ana Brnabic, 41, became one of the few openly gay government leaders in the world when she came to power in June, but activists say anti-gay prejudice remains a widespread problem in conservative Serbia.This year is the first time a prime minister is joining the rainbow-clad revellers, who are expected to number around 3,000, according to organisers.They will march under the eye of 2,000 police officers, less than half the number deployed for last year&#8217;s peaceful parade, said organiser Goran Miletic.&#8221;Every year is a positive step forward,&#8221; he told AFP.Brnabic was selected to be premier by her predecessor, Aleksandar Vucic, after he was elected president. She had entered politics less than a year earlier as public administration minister.While the surprise move made international headlines, sceptics suspected an attempt at &#8220;pinkwashing&#8221;, with Brnabic used as a puppet by Vucic to improve Serbia&#8217;s image as it campaigns to join the European Union.Critics accuse Vucic, who remains the country&#8217;s most powerful politician, of being a populist authoritarian who has clamped down on media freedom.At a conference on hate speech on Friday, Brnabic dismissed as &#8220;nonsense&#8221; the accusation that she had been chosen merely because of her sexual orientation.A technocrat with a business background, she has expressed hope in interviews that people will look beyond her sexual orientation, distancing herself from LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) issues.&#8221;Diversity and tolerance must not be reduced to recognition and appreciation of members of the LGBT population only, but must encompass other minority groups as well,&#8221; she said in her speech Friday.Belgrade&#8217;s first Pride march, in 2001, ended with police firing in the air to disperse anti-gay nationalists and skinheads who stoned and beat participants.Nearly a decade later in 2010, another parade was allowed to go ahead but again descended into violence between anti-gay protesters and police, prompting a three-year ban on the event.Activist groups are currently campaigning for the adoption of a law on the registration of same-sex partnerships, for which they hope to win the premier&#8217;s support.A government press release said two other ministers would join Brnabic at the parade, which is due to start at 12:40 pm (1040 GMT).-AFP
