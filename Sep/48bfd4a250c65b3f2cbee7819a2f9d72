Future SA has responded to the KPMG s withdrawal of the SARS spy Unit report and also welcome the resignation of eight staff members.Future SA believes that the resignations of a number of senior KPMG officials is a good start to the matter. The auditing firm was responsible for the findings and recommendations of the spy Unit report which accused former finance minister Pravin Gordhan for endorsing the unit. KPMG must realise the extent of the damage that their work caused South Africa, Future SA said in a statement. Their report on the so-called rogue unit at SARS, lent credence to fallacious stories about one of the most effective investigative units in South Africa, and contributed to the capture of SARS. SARS is now a shadow of its former self, it said.Future SA said KPMG s report has damaged the good image of SARS. Future SA said it agrees with Dr Iraj Abedian s assessment that KPMG failed in material respects to their work for the Gupta family. This once distinguished firm failed the elementary test of competency when it audited the books of the Guptas Wedding Project Manager. No auditing procedure can convert wedding expenses into business expenses, it said.Future SA has called upon businesses to advice their auditors to refrain from KPMG s illegal activities. The organisation has called for an independent inquiry into KPMG s activities in South Africa.-TNA Reporter
