VETERAN Ndebele artist Esther Mahlangu has been honoured with a colourful mural named Xola, which takes up two lanes on Franklin and West Broadway streets in New York. Created by artist Imani Shanklin Roberts, in partnership with South African Tourism, SAA and Citi Bike, the unveiling comes just days before the country celebrates Heritage Day on Sunday.Roberts recently took to social media saying that when she first arrived in New York in 2009, dedicating her work to someone of Mahlangu s calibre was not easy. When I first came to New York to attend @prattinstitute in 2009 I didn t imagine that this would be a city I would have a child in, create lasting memories in, let alone have success in my artistry in. Creating a mural in honour of an artist I ve known all my life, in a city that isn t welcoming to many, feels unreal, she said.Roberts said the artwork was representative of a feminine energy force that was all encompassing, inclusive and awe-inspiring.siyabongas@thenewage.co.za-Siyabonga Sithole
