Corruption at municipalities play a part in the political killings in KwaZulu-Natal, said Pongola ANC councilor Nqaba Mkhwanazi.Speaking in front of the Moerane Commission on Monday Mkhwanazi said that he thinks the reason why so many councilors are being murdered is that of the two camps within the ANC.&#8220;The two camps are an extension of divisions in provincial leadership. Tensions arise when provincial leadership chooses someone who got the least votes to lead after a PR conference.&#8220;I also think that another reason for the killings is because of the high levels of corruption in municipalities,&#8221; said Mkhwanazi.During his testimony, Mkhwanazi confirmed that his friend and fellow Pongolo ANC councillor Mbhekiseni Khumalo was murdered in December 2016.Khumalo, 58, who was an ANC councillor for five years in Pongola was shot dead at his home by people who pretended to need help from him.Mkhwanazi said that after Khumalo was elected to be a councillor, there was a group which was not happy about the elections and wanted a by-election.&#8220;I tried to speak to the group about the problem but they said they would only speak about it when Khumalo is dead,&#8221; said Mkhwanazi.Mkhwanazi stated that the ANC members who were unhappy with Khumalo after his death became friends with IFP members.He also indicated that the by-election was never going to be easy as the ANC, IFP and NFP have strong support in Pongolo.&nbsp;-TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;
