Judgment has been reserved in Lodidox director Mzwanele Manyi&#8217;s urgent application to have acting Judge Fiona Dippenaar recuse herself from his ongoing defamation case with Magdalena Wierzycka.Manyi&#8217;s counsel Advocate Vuyami Ngalwana SC, today argued in the South Gauteng High Court that by virtue of Judge Dippenaar belonging to the same chambers and being colleagues in a law firm where Wierzycka s counsel David Unterhalter SC is her senior would prejudice him in getting a fair trial.&#8220;Please see this through the lens of my client. He isn&#8217;t a lawyer by profession please look at this through the reasonableness theory which is context based and not rationality,&#8221; said Ngalwana.Ngalwana added that an impartial judge is a fundamental prerequisite for adjudicating a case and that judges should recuse themselves for whatever reason &#8211; even if they do not believe that bias exists.Manyi, through his legal representative, argued that because he (Manyi) was vocal on white capital monopoly and had supported protests around the slow transformation of the economy, he was concerned that the acting judge may be swayed by Wierzycka &#8211; a wealthy white business woman.However, Unterhalter shot back saying as far as the test for bias is concerned the onus must not just be based on reasonableness but it must also be based on a correct fact.&#8220;Mr. Manyi bears the onus to prove that My lady will be biased on the case. Not just a mere perception. It&#8217;s a balancing test the requirement for the correct fact is a key requirement. The request should not be based on presumption and this my lady is a presumption,&#8221; he said.Unterhalter went further saying his and Dippenaar&#8217;s mutual membership to the same group of chambers would not bring bias when Dippenaar presides over a case.&#8220;You do so with the utmost impartiality,&#8221; he said.He also added that to note the race of the acting judge and its effects on the case was &#8220;unfounded&#8221;.&#8220;This judgment needs careful consideration and this I will reserve judgment,&#8221; said Dippenaar before adjourning proceedings.No date has yet been set for the judgment.-Siphiwe Mchunu
