The ANC in KZN said the province was going through a difficult time due to the resurgence of political violence and called on citizens to help catch the killers.Speaking on behalf of the KZN ANC s executive committee, provincial secretary Super Zuma yesterday said the difficult time requires all sectors of society to combine their efforts to find a lasting solution.Zuma said the party was saddened and shocked by the recent death of Kwazikwakhe Mkhize, a ward councillor from Umkhambathini local municipality and Sindiso Magaqa on Monday. We call on our people who have any information relating to the killings to come before the commission of inquiry or the law enforcement agencies for us to overcome the scourge of the killings, Zuma said.He said his party remained hopeful that the work of the Moerane commission of inquiry which is probing political killings in KZN and the high-level police investigation team will ultimately produce outcomes that bring an end to the killings.As part of its commitment to finding a solution, he said the ANC would appear and make its submission to the commission of inquiry to provide the commission with the party s interpretation and analysis on the killings of politicians.He said they had established two teams. The first one will deal with an internal investigation into the causes of murders in the organization and the second to deal with the political work engaging ANC members and all its structures that will include political education and the importance of unity, cohesion, and tolerance among its members.In an apparent response to EFF leader Julius Malema who yesterday claimed that Magaqa was about to join his party before he was killed, Zuma said that was opportunism of the lowest order. We have no doubt that Magaqa was a loyal member of our movement. We have noted that some people are now trying to claim that Magaqa was about to join their party and we see that as an attempt to score political points while we are mourning. We know that he had refused several times to leave the ANC even when the carrot of a big position was dangled before him, he said.The ANCYL in the province said Malema was lying when he claimed they had received a special invitation from the Magaqa family to attend the funeral.The league s secretary-general Thanduxolo Sabelo said Malema was claiming an easy victory.Magaqa is expected to be buried next week.sihlem@thenewage.co.za
