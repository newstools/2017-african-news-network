The Democratic Alliance caucus in Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality, Fort Beaufort says it is disappointed by the council s failure to adopt crucial items that are essential to providing service delivery.The municipality which was recently in the news when its Council speaker Thozama Njobe was short in a hail of bullets, needed to adopt and submit annual financial statements to the Auditor General by 31 August 2017 as required by legislation, along with an Integrated Development Plan (IDP).The municipality which is under DA&#8217;s caucus leader Nomvano Zibonda said both of the above items could not be approved due to the adjournment of the Council meeting, the same Council meeting intended to adopt them.&#8220;The council meeting ended due to ANC councilors disrupting proceedings because some of them were not happy with the appointment of a Municipal Manager,&#8221; said Zibonda.She said a new Speaker was also supposed to be elected following the brutal killing of former Speaker Njobe.&#8220;Our Municipality has been without a Speaker for close to two months now, the office is meant to handle public participation and the wellness of inactive councilors,&#8221; she said.TNA Reporter
