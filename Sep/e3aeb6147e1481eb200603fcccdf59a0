The Democratic Alliance (DA) said on Tuesday that it will lay bribery and corruption charges against ANC Youth League’s President Collen Maine and Just Coal CEO  Joe Singh after he admitted to paying an R500 000 “donation” to the youth league.  Speaking to a radio station on Monday, Singh admitted that he paid the half a million to the youth league to help with the facilitation of their deal with Eskom after it was facing termination. “Singh’s shameless on-air confession is an admission of guilt and Maine’s acceptance of the questionable “donation” points towards his complicity in a crime,” said DA. According to reports, Maine is alleged to have accepted the R500 000 “donation” from Singh, expecting that the Youth League would convince Eskom against terminating Just Coal’s contract which was coming to an end.  “This was not just a donation. This was clearly a bribe to persuade politically aligned individuals close to Eskom to act in Just Coal’s interest,” DA said. The DA calls on the Youth League to pronounce their position on these allegations.  “The DA also calls on the ANCYL to come clean and prove that this was a legitimate donation and that the monies did not line the pockets of any one individual but that it went towards the empowerment of our youth.” During the interview, Singh admitted that he gave the money to the Youth League with an expectation that things would go in their favour, however, Maine allegedly failed to get the contract continued as allegedly promised.   “Despite reports indicating that Maine failed to deliver on this promise, money still exchanged hands in what was clearly a blatant attempt to unduly influence an Eskom executive,” said DA -TNA Reporter
