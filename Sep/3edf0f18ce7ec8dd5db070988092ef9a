COSATU in the Western Cape has repeated its demand that President Jacob Zuma steps down and will deliver the same message to Parliament tomorrow. The message to the president is one of three the trade union federation will deliver in Cape Town as part of national protest action. Messages will also be delivered to the offices of Western Cape Premier Helen Zille and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Cosatu’s Western Cape secretary Tony Ehrenreich said Zille would be reminded that her party, the DA, was also a beneficiary of state capture. “Zille’s office says they’re not involved in state capture. She got money from the Guptas. She’s denying state capture when they gave state properties to developers. They have captured the DA. The wealthy have captured the DA,” Ehrenreich said. He said Cosatu wanted Prasa to launch an urgent investigation into the quality of its services in the province. “The trains are in crisis. We want an urgent investigation into the shortages of trains.” Of Zuma, Ehrenreich said: “We are calling for an end to state capture by the Guptas. We want Zuma to step down because he has allowed it to happen.” Ehrenreich described as “unfortunate” a decision by the National Union of Metalworkers not to support Cosatu tomorrow. “It’s unfortunate that other unions are not effectively supporting us. Unless the working class unites, we will not change the agenda. It’s in the interest of the workers that we continue to engage the rulers of the country.” DENNIS CRUYWAGEN   dennisc@thenewage.co.za
