A WELL-KNOWN cement company recently handed over mobile science and IT labs to the Molly Blackburn High School in Eastern Cape. The popular company partnered with the government and other corporate stakeholders to assist with other critical infrastructure needed at the school.The labs feature curriculum assessment policy statement syllabus for life sciences and physical science subjects and also provide a cost-effective mobile solution in schools that don t have their own laboratory, delivering an integrated approach towards teaching and learning science and technology and bringing these subjects to life. The mobile labs are an ideal alternative for underprivileged schools such as this one and incorporates both technology and the science equipment needed to conduct experiments covered in the high school science syllabus, bringing physics and chemistry to life as never before, the company s manager of group CSI, Kabira Akoob, said.The company has already positively impacted more than 10 000 pupils, opening up new career paths for them to become South Africa s next generation of engineers, scientists and technicians. The labs are self-sufficient portable structures on wheels, which will be used to teach science to pupils at the school going forward, enabling practical interactive demonstrations and appropriate revision for exams. Providing access to quality, meaningful education remains one of our continent and country s greatest challenges, Akoob said. For education to create tangible future opportunities for our children, corporates need to collaborate with the government and communities to help pupils to develop the skills they need to achieve their dreams. Workshops and psychometric analysis will be offered to assist pupils at the school with their subject selection and provide them with career guidance going forward. Through this assessment, they will be better equipped to select subjects.-Shonisani Tshikalange
