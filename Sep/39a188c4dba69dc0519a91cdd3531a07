You have every right to be angry at me, and I deserve your anger at this matter, because no matter how you look at it, it was wrong in every way, to this extent I am sorry, he said. Following pressure from civil organizations and political parties calling for him to step down, Manana resigned from his position as deputy minister, however, remained an ANC MP. I have decided on my own to step down from the position of deputy minister of education. He appeared in the Randburg Magistrate s Court in August where he was granted a bail of R5000. The DA has reportedly announced that they will stage a picket outside the court during his appearance in support of the victim.
