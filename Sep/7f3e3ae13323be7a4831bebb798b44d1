PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma says the Mpumalanga provincial government will throw its support behind internationally renowned artist Esther Mahlangu, 81, who is famous for her bold, large-scale, contemporary paintings that reference her Ndebele heritage. Zuma lauded Mahlangu, who is affectionately known as “Nostokana” to the Ndebele nation, as his special guest at the national Heritage Day celebration in Ga-Morwe near Siyabuswa at the weekend. He said the sponsorship by the provincial government of Mahlangu’s work was part of building a legacy for her as she was playing a vital role in enhancing the country’s heritage worldwide despite her age. “As we celebrate our music, languages, cultures and traditions today, we acknowledge the impressive contribution to our heritage such as the sophisticated works of Ndebele art by Mama Esther Mahlangu, which continues to dazzle the design world. “I am pleased that the government in this province will sponsor a dedicated project on her works as part of building a long-lasting legacy of Mama Mahlangu,” Zuma said. He said the country was proud of the Mpumalanga province for also producing a number of music legends. “We acknowledge Mpumalanga artists who have made a contribution to our culture and music in various ways, such as uMama Nothembi Mkhwebane, an iconic figure deserving of the title of being the queen of Ndebele music. “The province has also produced talented artists such as Rebecca Malope, Sipho Makhabane and Ray Phiri, who used music to promote freedom from apartheid repression,” Zuma said.
