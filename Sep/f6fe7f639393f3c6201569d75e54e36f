African News Networks (ANN7) has announced the launch of ANC DECIDES – ANC DEMOCRACY IN ACTION, to be premiered on 25 September on trendsetting 24-hour news channel ANN7 DStv 405. ANC Decides will be hosted by Mfundo Mabalane. The show will focus on the ANC’s policy discussions and the regeneration of the organization leading up to the national elective conference in December. Each show will consist of a panel of political analysts and newsmakers and debate issues accentuated by the resolutions put forward at the June policy conference of Africa’s oldest liberation movement. ANC Decides will bring the viewers firsthand information from the hinterland. It will be a unique platform for the rank and file members and officials of the ANC to articulate their views on the policy conference’s resolutions to be decided on at the elective conference. It will feature prominent leaders, analysts and public figures as part of ongoing panel debates to discuss different issues aired by the structures of the ANC. For the 54th ANC Elective conference in December, ANN7’s teams, analysts and guests will broadcast
live from the conference and from the Midrand studios bringing breaking news and outcomes as they
are announced. Over the next three months, four dedicated teams will travel the length and breadth of the country not only following the nominated candidates on their campaign trail but also seeking out the debates at the branch and regional level on policy and other issues central to the elective conference. Tune in to ANN7 on DSTV Channel 405 on Monday to Friday 5pm and repeat on 7.30pm and 8.30am the following day. Follow us online with our hashtag #ANCdecides
