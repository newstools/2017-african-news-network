The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) has on Tuesday revealed that the late ANC Youth League leader Sindiso Magaqa was a key witness in the probe of political killings in the province.Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says the police will now open a murder case as opposed to the attempted murder they opened initially.&#8220;I do not want to divulge anything because we ve received very sensitive information. Magaqa&#8217;s death is a serious setback as he was one of the key witnesses in our investigation, Mulaudzi said.Magaqa was shot at in July this year by unknown people at UMzimkhulu in the southern part of the province. At the time it was reported that he was from a council meeting when he was shot at.Meanwhile, Police had earlier released two identity kits which have a suspect believed to be involved in the shooting.The African National Congress has condemned the political killings in the Province during the 2016 local government elections.In the build up to the Local elections, both members of the ANC and the SACP were at each other s throat over their preferred ward councilors, which results in more people losing their lives.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
